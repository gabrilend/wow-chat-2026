liquid.h (issue 173r) - where the water is, for the mover

For a general audience: keeps every water layer of every loaded tile
(adt.h's AdtLiquid), filed by chunk, and answers "how high is the
water's surface here, and what kind of water is it?". The surface
between a cell's four corners is blended, as the ground's is.
Buildings' pools (wmo.h's WmoPool) are kept too, each with its
building's placement: a spot is turned into the building's own space,
its pool cell found, and the surface's height turned back into the
world's.

## What it offers

- `typedef struct LiquidWorld LiquidWorld;`
- `LiquidWorld *liquid_new(void);`
- `void liquid_free(LiquidWorld *w);`
- `void liquid_add_tile(LiquidWorld *w, int tx, int ty, const AdtTile *t);`
  Files tile (tx, ty)'s water layers (from its ground file).
- `void liquid_add_pool(LiquidWorld *w, int tile, const float at[16], double ox, double oy, const WmoPool *p, int kind);`
  Files a building's pool, of kind `kind` (LiquidType.dbc id), placed by
  `at` (the building's placement, Raylib's layout, relative to the
  drawing origin `ox`, `oy`), brought by map tile `tile` (tx * 64 + ty).
  The pool's grid is copied.
- `void liquid_drop_tile(LiquidWorld *w, int tx, int ty);`
  Forgets tile (tx, ty)'s water, its pools included (the tile is dropped, 173s).
- `float liquid_surface(const LiquidWorld *w, double x, double y, int *kind);`
  The highest water surface at world (x, y): its height, and its kind
  (LiquidType.dbc id) in *kind; below -10000 when there is no water.
