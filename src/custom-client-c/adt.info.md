adt.h (issue 173f) - the original client's ground files

For a general audience: the game keeps each 533-yard square of a map in
its own ground file (an "ADT", World\Maps\<map>\<map>_<ty>_<tx>.adt, the
west-east tile number first). Each file is cut into 16 x 16 chunks of
33.3 yards. For every chunk it holds the ground's heights, and up to
four ground pictures (grass, dirt, rock ...) with a blend map for each
picture above the first, saying how strongly it shows at each of
64 x 64 points. The client paints the ground by blending them. It also
holds a baked shadow map per chunk (173h) and the list of trees,
rocks and buildings placed on the tile (173g).

File layout (3.3.5a; little-endian; every block is a four-letter tag
stored reversed, then its size, then its data): MVER, MHDR, MCIN,
MTEX (the tile's picture names, each ended by a zero byte), MMDX, MMID,
MWMO, MWID, MDDF, MODF, MH2O, then 256 MCNK blocks, one per chunk.

MCNK header (128 bytes), the fields read here, by byte offset:
   0 flags (0x8000: the blend maps' last row and column are real, not
     to be copied from the row and column before them)
   4 index x (west to east, 0-15)        8 index y (north to south)
  12 layer count (1-4)                  20 offset of MCVT (heights)
  24 offset of MCNR (normals)           28 offset of MCLY (layers)
  36 offset of MCAL (blend maps)        40 MCAL's size, counting its own
                                           8-byte head (trusted over the
                                           size inside MCAL, which can be
                                           wrong in packed tiles)
  44 offset of MCSH (shadow)            48 MCSH's size
  60 holes (16 bits: 4 x 4, each bit hiding 2 x 2 cells)
 104 position: world x (north), world y (west), base height
 116 offset of MCCV (colour tints; present when flags & 0x40)
Offsets count from the MCNK tag and point at each block's own tag.

MCVT: 145 floats, heights above the base: a row of 9 corners, then a
row of 8 cell centres, and so on ((9 + 8) x 8 + 9). Rows run south
(world x falls by 33.3 / 8 yards a row) and columns run east (world y
falls); adt_corner / adt_centre give the index. Checked against the
server's own heights for the same ground (tests/test_client.c).
MCLY: 16 bytes a layer: picture number in MTEX, flags (0x100: has a
blend map; 0x200: the blend map is run-length packed), its offset in
MCAL, a ground-effect number.
MCAL: per layer above the first, 64 x 64 strengths. The map's WDT says
which form: 4 bits a point (2048 bytes; Kalimdor) or 8 bits (4096,
plain or packed).
MCSH: 64 x 64 bits, 8 bytes a row, lowest bit first; 1 = shadowed.
MCCV: 145 colours (blue, green, red, alpha bytes), one per height, in
  MCVT's order; 127 means "unchanged", so the ground's colour is
  multiplied by value / 127 (0 to 2). Added in 3.3.5a.

Placements (173g). MMDX: small-model names, each ended by a zero byte;
MMID: where each name starts in MMDX; MDDF: 36 bytes a placement:
name number (into MMID), unique id, position (3 floats), rotation
(3 floats, degrees), scale (u16, 1024 = 1.0), flags (u16). MWMO / MWID /
MODF the same for buildings, 64 bytes each: name number, unique id,
position, rotation, bounding box (6 floats), flags, doodad set (u16),
name set (u16), unused (u16).
Positions are in placement space, measured from the map's north-west
corner: world x = 17066.67 - p[2], world y = 17066.67 - p[0],
world z = p[1] (checked: trees stand on the server's ground; tests).
A building crossing tile edges is listed in every tile it touches,
with the same unique id.

Water (173r). MH2O: 256 heads of 12 bytes (offset of the chunk's
layers, layer count, offset of attributes; offsets from MH2O's data),
then each layer (24 bytes): 0 liquid kind (u16, LiquidType.dbc), 2
point format (u16: 0 heights and depths, 1 heights and picture
positions, 2 depths only: flat at the lowest height, 3 all three),
4 lowest height, 8 highest height, 12 first column, 13 first row, 14
width, 15 height (cells, u8), 16 offset of a which-cells bitmap
(width x height bits, row by row, lowest bit first; 0: all), 20
offset of the points ((width+1) x (height+1) heights, floats, first).

An AdtTile, field by field:
  textures     char[nt][128]: the picture names (MTEX), in file order
  ntextures    int
  chunks[256]  AdtChunk, by row (index y) * 16 + column (index x)
An AdtChunk:
  ix, iy       int: column (west to east) and row (north to south)
  x, y, z      float: world position of the chunk's north-west corner,
               and the height the 145 heights are added to
  heights[145] float: above z, MCVT order
  holes        uint16_t: MCNK's low-resolution hole bits
  nlayers      int, 1-4
  tex[4]       int: each layer's picture number (into textures)
  alpha[4][4096] uint8_t: each layer's strength, 0-255, row by row
               (row = south, column = east); layer 0's is all 255
  shadow[4096] uint8_t: 1 where shadowed, 0 where lit
  tint[145][3] uint8_t: red, green, blue per height, 127 = unchanged
               (all 127 when the chunk has no MCCV)
An AdtPlace (a doodad or a building):
  name         int: into models (doodads) or buildings
  uid          uint32_t: the placement's unique id, shared across tiles
  x, y, z      float: world position
  rot[3]       float: the file's rotation, degrees (see doodads.c)
  scale        float: 1.0 = as made (buildings always 1)
An AdtLiquid (one water layer in one chunk):
  chunk        int: which chunk (row * 16 + column)
  kind         int: LiquidType.dbc id (1 water, 2 ocean, 3 magma, 4 slime,
               5 slow water ...)
  col, row, w, h  int: the cells it covers, 0-8 within the chunk
  wet[8][8]    uint8_t: per cell of the chunk (row, column), 1 when it
               has water
  height[9][9] float: the surface's height at each corner (row, column)
               of the chunk's cell grid, where the layer gives one
  doodad_set   int: buildings only, which set of furnishings to show
  lo[3], hi[3] float: buildings only, the world box the building fills
               (MODF's extents, turned into world axes)

## What it offers

- `type AdtChunk`
- `type AdtPlace`
- `type AdtLiquid`
- `type AdtTile`
- `int adt_wdt_big_alpha(const unsigned char *s, size_t len, char *why, int why_len);`
  Whether a map's blend maps are 8 bits a point, from its WDT file
  (MPHD flags & 0x4). Returns 1 or 0, or -1 with `why` set when the WDT
  can't be read.
- `int adt_read(const unsigned char *s, size_t len, int big_alpha, AdtTile *out, char *why, int why_len);`
  Reads one ground file. 0 on success; otherwise `why` names what was
  wrong and where (block tag, chunk index). `out` is large (about 5 MB):
  allocate it, don't put it on the stack.
- `void adt_free(AdtTile *t);`
- `void adt_place_matrix(const AdtPlace *p, double ox, double oy, float m[16]);`
  A placement's turn, size and position as a 4 x 4 matrix, laid out as
  Raylib's Matrix is (m[0], m[4], m[8], m[12] the first row; a point p
  goes to m[0]*p.x + m[4]*p.y + m[8]*p.z + m[12], and so on), relative to
  the drawing origin (ox, oy). The turn follows the order the original's
  own model viewer uses, with its rotation angles in degrees:
    world = to_world * turn_y(ry - 90) * turn_z(-rx) * turn_x(rz) * to_placement * scale
  to_placement takes a model's axes (x front, y left, z up) into placement
  space (y up): (x, y, z) -> (x, z, -y). to_world takes placement space
  into the world (x north, y west, z up): (x, y, z) -> (-z, -x, y). With
  only ry set, a model's front ends up facing world angle ry + 180
  degrees (tests).
- `void adt_inside_matrix(const float building[16], const float pos[3], const float quat[4], float scale, float m[16]);`
  Something placed inside a building (a furnishing: position, turn as a
  quaternion x, y, z, w, and size, all in the building's own space) as a
  matrix in the world: building = the building's adt_place_matrix. Same
  layout as above. Scale first, then the turn, then the move, then the
  building's own place.
- `type AdtWdl`
  A map's low-detail heights (its .wdl, 173s): per tile (tile x * 64 +
  tile y) a 17 x 17 grid of corner heights (rows south, columns east, as
  the ground files run), 16 rows of 16 hole bits (lowest bit the first
  column), and whether the tile has any. Layout: MAOF, 4096 file offsets
  (0 none), each to an MARE block (17 x 17 corners, then 16 x 16 centres,
  signed 16-bit yards) followed by MAHO (the holes). About 2.5 MB:
  allocate it.
- `int adt_wdl_read(const unsigned char *s, size_t len, AdtWdl *out, char *why, int why_len);`
