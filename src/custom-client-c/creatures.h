/*
 * creatures.h (issue 173t) - where the world's creatures stand
 *
 * For a general audience: until the client talks to a server, the list of
 * creatures (guards, vendors, deer, wolves) comes from a file that
 * scripts/generate-custom-client-creatures writes out of the server's
 * world database: one line per creature, saying which creature it is,
 * which look to draw, how big, where it stands and which way it faces.
 * This reads that file and files the creatures by map tile, so the client
 * can bring in a tile's creatures when it loads the tile, and drop them
 * with it. Nothing here draws.
 *
 * The file: lines starting "#" are comments; every other line is
 * tab-separated: guid, entry, display, size, x, y, z, facing (radians),
 * name.
 *
 * A Spawn, field by field:
 *   guid      uint32_t: the spawn's own number in the database
 *   entry     uint32_t: which creature (creature_template)
 *   display   int: the look to draw (CreatureDisplayInfo.dbc id)
 *   size      float: its size, times the display's own
 *   x, y, z   double: where it stands (world yards)
 *   facing    float: radians, as hers (0 = north, counter-clockwise)
 *   name      char[64]: its name, for messages
 *   tile      int: its map tile, tx * 64 + ty (maps.h's numbering)
 * A SpawnList holds them sorted by tile.
