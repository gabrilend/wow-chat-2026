/*
 * mpq.h (issue 173k; the C twin of lib/mpq.lua) - files out of the game's archives
 *
 * For a general audience: the original game keeps every model, texture
 * and table inside a few large archive files (the .MPQ files in Data). Each is a small
 * filing cabinet: an index (the "hash table") says, for a file's name,
 * which drawer it is in; a second list (the "block table") says where that
 * drawer starts, how big it is, and whether its contents are compressed or
 * scrambled; both lists are scrambled with a fixed, publicly known recipe.
 * This reads them, finds a file by name, and unpacks it (zlib, sector by
 * sector). A chain searches the client's archives newest patch first.
 *
 * MPQ versions 1 and 2 (the 3.3.5a client's), from the format's public
 * description; only what these archives use: zlib, file keys with or
 * without the position fix. Anything else is an error naming the file.
