/*
 * settings.h (issue 173b1) - the settings store
 *
 * For a general audience: every setting the client has (window size,
 * camera speeds, and later every panel of the Options menu) is declared
 * once, in one table in settings.c, with its kind, range and default. The
 * player's changes are kept in one text file shaped like the original
 * game's WTF/Config.wtf (SET name "value"), holding only what differs
 * from the defaults. Code reads a setting by name each time it uses it,
 * so a change takes effect at once, with nothing to rebuild.
 *
 * Names are the original game's own (its "CVars": cameraYawMoveSpeed,
 * gxResolution ...) where the setting is the same thing, so the reference
 * page docs/custom-client-stock-options.md doubles as the list of names to
 * use. A project setting with no original twin gets a name of its own.
 *
 * A Setting, field by field:
 *   decl  the declaration (a SettingDecl in settings.c's table, read-only)
 *   num   double: the value as a number (toggle 0/1, slider, a numeric
 *         choice); 0 for text
 *   text  char[64]: the value as written in the file ("1280x720", "180")
