/*
 * ground_prep.h (issue 173u) - a tile's ground made ready, without the window
 *
 * For a general audience: loading a tile's ground has two halves. The
 * first is arithmetic: read the tile's ground file, work out every point
 * of its mesh (place, colour, and its light from the server's slopes),
 * pack its 256 blend maps into one picture, and unpack the ground
 * pictures it names. The second is handing all that to the graphics card.
 * Only the second half needs the window's thread; this file is the first
 * half, so the reading-ahead thread (prefetch.h) can do it for tiles she
 * hasn't reached yet, and the main thread is left only the sending
 * (ground.h). With no window it is also what the tests check.
 *
 * Every function here is safe on any thread: it touches the archive
 * reader (locked) and the server's heights (locked where they load), and
 * nothing else that is shared.
