/*
 * liquid.h (issue 173r) - where the water is, for the mover
 *
 * For a general audience: keeps every water layer of every loaded tile
 * (adt.h's AdtLiquid), filed by chunk, and answers "how high is the
 * water's surface here, and what kind of water is it?". The surface
 * between a cell's four corners is blended, as the ground's is.
 * Buildings' pools (wmo.h's WmoPool) are kept too, each with its
 * building's placement: a spot is turned into the building's own space,
 * its pool cell found, and the surface's height turned back into the
 * world's.
