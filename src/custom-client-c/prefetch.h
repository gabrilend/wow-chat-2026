/*
 * prefetch.h (issue 173u) - reading ahead of her, on a second thread
 *
 * For a general audience: when she walks into a new map tile, the client
 * loads that tile's ground, buildings and doodads, and most of the time
 * that takes is unpacking their files out of the game's archives. This
 * runs a helper thread that is told which tiles she is likely to reach
 * next (the ring just beyond those loaded) and unpacks their files ahead
 * of time into the archive reader's memory (mpq.h): the tile's ground
 * file, each doodad's model and skin and the pictures it names, each
 * building's root, parts and pictures. When the tile really loads, its
 * files are already unpacked. When told to, it also prepares each such
 * tile's ground (ground_prep.h: its points, blend picture, and the
 * pictures not yet on the card) and keeps it until the main thread takes
 * it, leaving that thread only the sending to the card. The helper draws
 * nothing; what it shares with the main thread is the archive reader's
 * memory and the server's heights (each locked) and its own keeping
 * (locked here).
