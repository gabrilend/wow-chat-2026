 * main.c (issue 173k; the C twin of src/custom-client/main.lua) - the window
 *
 * For a general audience: opens a window on the ground of Ashenvale near
 * Astranaar, read from the server's own map files, with the night elf of
 * the original game's archives standing on it; moves her with the game's
 * own controls at 120% speed (W/S forward and back, A/D turn or, with the
 * right mouse button held, strafe, Q and E strafe, space jump, left drag
 * turns the camera, right drag turns her with it, the wheel zooms; Escape
 * quits until the game menu exists). Written in C on Raylib (owner,
 * 2026-10-05: "let's port now. We should build something like an engine
 * in C anyway, for performance reasons").
 *
 * Usage: custom-client --maps DIR --client DIR [--settings FILE] [--world DIR] [--shot FILE] [--zoom N] [--front] [--turn DEG] [--pitch DEG]
 *   --settings FILE   the player's settings (SET name "value" lines; 173b1);
 *                     without it, every setting is at its default
 *   --shot FILE       draw a few frames, save a picture there, quit
 *   --world DIR       where the generated creature lists are (creatures-<map>.tsv, 173t)
 *   --no-read-ahead   no second thread reading tiles ahead (to measure what it saves; 173u)
 *   --zoom N          (pictures) the camera N yards back; 0 is first person
 *   --turn DEG        (pictures) the camera turned DEG degrees round her, held there
 *   --pitch DEG       (pictures) the camera raised DEG degrees (up to 83)
 *   --clock MS        (pictures) start the world's animations MS milliseconds in
 *   --hour H          the time of day, 0 to 24 (default: this machine's clock)
 *   --face DEG        her start facing turned DEG degrees (left)
 *   --walk S          (pictures) hold forward for S world-seconds
 *   --dive S          (pictures) then hold X (swim down) for S world-seconds
 *   --wait S          (pictures) then wait S world-seconds more
 *   --wear SLOT:LOOK,...  dress her, over her starting outfit: each slot's item look (ItemDisplayInfo id),
 *                     e.g. chest:41143,hands:41138,legs:41140,waist:41476,feet:41480
 *   --goto X Y        (pictures) one world-second in, move her to world (X, Y)
 *   --map ID X Y      start on map ID (Map.dbc: 0 Eastern Kingdoms, 1 Kalimdor,
 *                     530 Outland, 571 Northrend) at world (X, Y)
 *   --pose ID MS      (pictures) hold her in animation ID (AnimationData.dbc:
 *                     0 stand, 5 run, 13 walk backwards, 38 jump ...) at MS
