/*
 * particles.h (issue 173o) - a model's particle emitters, read and run
 *
 * For a general audience: a torch's flame, a wisp's glow, a firefly's
 * spark are particles: many small pictures born at a point on the model,
 * flying off with a speed and a spread, pulled by gravity, slowed by
 * drag, changing colour, opacity and size as they age, then gone. The
 * model file lists its emitters, each riding on a bone. This reads them
 * and runs them; drawing (camera-facing squares) is the caller's.
 *
 * Emitter layout (3.3.5a, 476 bytes, at the header's 296: count, 300:
 * offset):
 *     0 id     4 flags (0x10000: each particle takes a random picture cell)
 *     8 position (3 floats, model space)   20 bone (u16)   22 picture slot (u16)
 *    40 blend (u8: 0 solid, 1 cut-out, 2 see-through, 3-4 added light)
 *    41 shape (u8: 1 plane, 2 sphere, 3 spline: treated as a plane)
 *    48 picture grid rows (u16)   50 columns (u16)
 *    52 speed   72 speed variation   92 vertical spread   112 horizontal
 *       spread   132 gravity   152 lifespan (all 20-byte float tracks)
 *   172 lifespan variation (float)   176 rate (track)   196 rate variation
 *   200 area length   220 area width   240 z source (tracks)
 *   260 colour over life   276 opacity   292 size (each a 16-byte "life
 *       block": moments as a share of the life, 0 to 32767, then values:
 *       colours 3 floats 0-255, opacity 16-bit 0-32767, sizes 2 floats)
 *   308 size variation (2 floats)   316 picture cell over life (block)
 *   372 drag   456 enabled (a byte track: 0 stops new particles)
 * Tracks follow the model's animations, as bones' do (anim.h).
 *
 * An Emitter, field by field: bone (int), pos[3] (float, model space),
 * slot (int, the model's picture slot), blend, shape, rows, cols (int),
 * flags (uint32_t), the tracks (AnimTrack), life_vary and rate_vary
 * (float, shares), drag (float), size_vary[2] (float), and four life
 * blocks (PartBlock: n keys of time 0-1 and up to 3 values).
