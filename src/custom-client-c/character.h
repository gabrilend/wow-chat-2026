 * character.h (issue 173k; the C twin of lib/character.lua) - one player

 * For a general audience: a race's model holds every hair style and
 * clothing shape at once, and its skin is painted from several pictures
 * laid onto one sheet (body, face, scalp, underwear). The game picks which
 * pieces show and which pictures go where from its own tables
 * (CharHairGeosets, CharacterFacialHairStyles, CharSections); this does
 * the same for one character's choices, and dresses it in its items
 * (173p).
