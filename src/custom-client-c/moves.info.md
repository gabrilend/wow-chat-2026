moves.h (issue 173i) - which animation she plays, from what she is doing

For a general audience: each frame, this looks at what the character
is doing (running, walking backwards, turning on the spot, in the air,
just landed, standing) and picks the matching animation of her model,
with the game's own animation numbers. It keeps the animation's clock,
plays the run faster or slower to match her real speed (so her feet
don't slide), plays one-off animations (a jump's start, a landing, an
idle fidget) once and then returns, and blends from the old animation
to the new one over the new one's blend time (150 ms when it gives
none) so changes don't snap.

Strafing turns her body toward where she is going (45 degrees running
diagonally, 90 straight sideways) while she plays the run; this is this
client's reading of the original, to be compared with it.

A MovesInput (this frame):
  forward, back, strafe_left, strafe_right, turn_left, turn_right
                  int, 0 or 1: what she is being asked to do
  grounded        int, 0 or 1: standing on ground after the move
  rising          int, 0 or 1: going up (a jump) rather than down
  swimming        int, 0 or 1: swimming (173r): swim, swim backwards,
                  swim left and right (no body turn), or treading water
  walking         int, 0 or 1: walk toggled (173i): the walk instead of
                  the run, forward and strafing (played at her speed too)
  speed           float, yards a second along the ground this frame
  dt              float, seconds
A MovesState:
  seq, ms         int, float: the animation playing and how far into it
  from, from_ms   int, float: the animation blended from (-1 none)
  blend, blend_left float, ms: the blend's length and what remains
  once            int, 0 or 1: the animation plays once, then the
                  state is chosen afresh
  airborne        int, 0 or 1: in the air last frame
  air_ms          float: how long in the air
  body_turn       float, radians: her body's turn from her facing
                  (strafing), eased toward its target

## What it offers

- `type MovesInput`
  the game's animation numbers used here (AnimationData.dbc)
- `type MovesState`
- `void moves_init(MovesState *s, const Anim *a);`
  Starts standing.
- `void moves_step(MovesState *s, const Anim *a, const MovesInput *in);`
  One frame: picks and advances the animation.
- `void moves_play(MovesState *s, const Anim *a, int id);`
  For figures with no mover (173j): play animation `id` (variation 0),
  looping, blended in from the current one; and advance the clock at the
  animation's own pace. Neither looks at movement.
- `void moves_advance(MovesState *s, const Anim *a, float dt);`
- `void moves_pose(const MovesState *s, const Anim *a, uint32_t global_ms, float (*poses)[16], float (*scratch)[16]);`
  The bones' poses for this frame (the blend applied); `scratch` holds
  nbones matrices for the blended-from pose.
