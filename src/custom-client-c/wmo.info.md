wmo.h (issue 173g) - the game's buildings

For a general audience: a building (Astranaar's inn, a cave, a bridge)
is a "world map object" (WMO). It comes as a root file, which lists its
pictures and materials, how many parts ("groups") it has, and the
furnishings placed inside it (barrels, lamps: small models, in named
sets), and one file per group (<name>_000.wmo, _001 ...) holding that
part's points and triangles, cut into batches of one material each.
Points are in the same model space as small models (x front, y left,
z up), so a building is placed with the same matrix (adt_place_matrix).

Layouts (3.3.5a, version 17; blocks as in ground files: a reversed
four-letter tag, a size, then data).
Root: MOHD (header: 4 group count, 16 furnishing name count, 20
  furnishing count, 24 set count), MOTX (picture names, zero-ended, at
  offsets), MOMT (64 bytes a material: 0 flags, 8 blend mode, 12 first
  picture's MOTX offset), MODS (32 bytes a set: 20-byte name, 20 first
  furnishing, 24 count), MODN (furnishing model names), MODD (40 bytes a
  furnishing: 0 name offset in MODN (low 24 bits), 4 position (3
  floats), 16 turn (quaternion x, y, z, w), 32 scale, 36 colour).
Group: MOGP's 68-byte header (8 flags: 0x2000 indoors, 0x4 has vertex
  colours), then inside MOGP: MOPY, MOVI (u16 triangle corners), MOVT
  (points), MONR (facings), MOTV (picture positions), MOBA (24 bytes a
  batch: 12 first index (u32), 16 count (u16), 23 material (u8)), MOCV
  (colours, blue-green-red-alpha: indoor groups' baked light).

Pool (MLIQ, inside MOGP; 173r): a 30-byte header (0 points across,
  4 points along, 8 cells across, 12 cells along (ints), 16 the grid's
  corner in the building's space (3 floats), 28 material (u16)); then 8
  bytes a point (4: its surface height, float), row by row along y;
  then a byte a cell, row by row: low four bits all set (0x?F) is a dry
  cell (the server's rule, WorldModel.cpp). Cells are 533.33 / 128
  yards (4.17) a side. The pool's kind (LiquidType.dbc id) comes from
  the group header's liquid field (MOGP + 52), see wmo_liquid_kind.

Material flags: 0x1 unlit, 0x2 no fog, 0x4 two-sided. Blend modes as
in models (m2.h): 0 opaque, 1 cut-out, 2 see-through, 3+ added light.

## What it offers

- `type WmoVertex`
- `type WmoBatch`
- `type WmoPool`
  A building part's pool (MLIQ), in the building's own space; nx 0: none.
    nx, ny        int: points across (x) and along (y); cells are one fewer each way
    corner[3]     float: the grid's first point (x, y; z unused, heights are per point)
    height        float[nx * ny]: each point's surface height, index y * nx + x
    cell          uint8_t[(nx-1) * (ny-1)]: each cell's flags, index y * (nx-1) + x
- `type WmoGroup`
- `type WmoMaterial`
  Whether a building's triangle is solid (173q), from its MOPY flags:
  0x08 collision, or 0x20 drawn and not 0x04 detail (the original's rule;
  invisible collision-only triangles are 0x08 alone).
- `type WmoFurnishing`
- `type WmoSet`
- `type WmoRoot`
- `int wmo_read_root(const unsigned char *s, size_t len, WmoRoot *out, char *why, int why_len);`
- `int wmo_read_group(const unsigned char *s, size_t len, WmoGroup *out, char *why, int why_len);`
- `int wmo_liquid_kind(const WmoRoot *r, const WmoGroup *g);`
  A part's pool's kind, as a LiquidType.dbc id, by the rule the server's
  map extractor uses (vmap4_extractor/wmo.cpp): the group's liquid field
  read as an id when the root's flag 0x4 says so, otherwise as an older
  numbering (15 none, else one less than the id); with none, the first
  wet cell's low four bits plus one. An older-numbered id under 21 maps
  to the building liquids: water 13 (14, the sea's, when the group's
  flag 0x80000), sea 14, magma 19, slime 20. 0 when the part has no
  pool.
- `void wmo_free_root(WmoRoot *r);`
- `void wmo_free_group(WmoGroup *g);`
