/*
 * collide.h (issue 173q) - the world's solid models, for the mover
 *
 * For a general audience: every tree, rock, wall, floor and bridge has a
 * solid shape: a set of triangles (simpler than what is drawn). This keeps
 * all of them, placed in the world, filed in a grid of 4-yard squares so
 * a question about one spot only looks at the triangles near it, and
 * answers the mover's two questions:
 *   the floor: what is the highest surface under (x, y) at or below a
 *     height (her feet plus a step), and how does it slope?
 *   walls: does moving from here to there run into something too steep to
 *     stand on, at her knees or above? If so, which way does it face, so
 *     she can slide along it?
 * The map's own ground is not here: the caller compares the two (main.c).
 *
 * Positions are kept relative to the drawing origin (ox, oy), as the
 * drawn models are, so single-precision numbers stay exact; questions
 * are asked in world coordinates and moved here.
