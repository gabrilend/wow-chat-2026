/*
 * moves.h (issue 173i) - which animation she plays, from what she is doing
 *
 * For a general audience: each frame, this looks at what the character
 * is doing (running, walking backwards, turning on the spot, in the air,
 * just landed, standing) and picks the matching animation of her model,
 * with the game's own animation numbers. It keeps the animation's clock,
 * plays the run faster or slower to match her real speed (so her feet
 * don't slide), plays one-off animations (a jump's start, a landing, an
 * idle fidget) once and then returns, and blends from the old animation
 * to the new one over the new one's blend time (150 ms when it gives
 * none) so changes don't snap.
 *
 * Strafing turns her body toward where she is going (45 degrees running
 * diagonally, 90 straight sideways) while she plays the run; this is this
 * client's reading of the original, to be compared with it.
 *
 * A MovesInput (this frame):
 *   forward, back, strafe_left, strafe_right, turn_left, turn_right
 *                   int, 0 or 1: what she is being asked to do
 *   grounded        int, 0 or 1: standing on ground after the move
 *   rising          int, 0 or 1: going up (a jump) rather than down
 *   speed           float, yards a second along the ground this frame
 *   dt              float, seconds
 * A MovesState:
 *   seq, ms         int, float: the animation playing and how far into it
 *   from, from_ms   int, float: the animation blended from (-1 none)
 *   blend, blend_left float, ms: the blend's length and what remains
 *   once            int, 0 or 1: the animation plays once, then the
 *                   state is chosen afresh
 *   airborne        int, 0 or 1: in the air last frame
 *   air_ms          float: how long in the air
 *   body_turn       float, radians: her body's turn from her facing
 *                   (strafing), eased toward its target
