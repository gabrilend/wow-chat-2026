 * navmesh_slope.h (issue 173k; the C twin of lib/navmesh-slope.lua)
 *
 * For a general audience: the server plans every creature's path on its
 * navigation mesh, built with one rule for how steep a slope can be and
 * still count as ground; the rule is written into the header of every
 * navigation tile file (the .mmtile files in data-files/mmaps). Reading it from there
 * means client and server share it. (The owner, 2026-10-05: monsters and
 * players may need different slope rules; the player's will come from the
 * original client once measured, 173e.)
 *
 * Tile header (MmapTileHeader, MapDefines.h; little-endian): 0 magic
 * "MMAP" (0x4d4d4150), 8 mmap version (19), 20 walkable slope (float, degrees).
