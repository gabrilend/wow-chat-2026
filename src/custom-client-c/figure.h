/*
 * figure.h (issues 173i, 173j) - an animated model in the world
 *
 * For a general audience: a "figure" is one animated model drawn in the
 * world: her, another player's race, or a creature. It holds the model's
 * pieces (one mesh and picture each), its points as made, and its
 * skeleton and animations (anim.h). Each frame its bones are posed (by a
 * MovesState, moves.h), its points bent to follow, and each piece's mesh
 * refreshed from them.
 *
 * Where a figure's pictures come from:
 *   a character (figure_from_character): its finished skin sheet and its
 *     hair, as character.c paints them;
 *   a creature (figure_from_display): the creature's display row in the
 *     client's CreatureDisplayInfo table names its model (through
 *     CreatureModelData) and up to three skins; a model's pictures of kind
 *     11, 12 and 13 are those skins, found in the model's own folder. A
 *     humanoid display (a townsperson: its row names a
 *     CreatureDisplayInfoExtra row) is built as a character instead, with
 *     that row's race, choices and clothes, wearing its baked skin sheet
 *     (173t);
 *   any model: pictures of kind 0 are named inside the model.
