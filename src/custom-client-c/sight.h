/*
 * sight.h (issue 173u) - what the camera can see
 *
 * For a general audience: the camera sees a wedge of the world (wider
 * farther off, cut off near and far). Drawing anything outside it is
 * wasted work the graphics card throws away, and every draw order costs
 * the processor. This keeps the wedge's six walls for the current frame
 * and answers "could a ball this big, here, be seen?", so tiles, doodads
 * and creatures outside the view aren't sent at all.
 *
 * Each wall is a plane: a, b, c, d with a*x + b*y + c*z + d >= 0 inside
 * (unit length a, b, c), in drawing coordinates (the world less the
 * drawing origin, as everything drawn is).
