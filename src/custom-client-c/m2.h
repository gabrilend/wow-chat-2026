/*
 * m2.h (issue 173k; the C twin of lib/m2.lua) - the game's models
 *
 * For a general audience: a model comes as two files: the .m2 holds every
 * corner point (where, which way its surface faces, where on its picture
 * it sits) and its list of pictures; the .skin file holds how the points
 * join into triangles, grouped into pieces ("geosets": the body, each hair
 * style, bare hands or gloves...), and which picture each piece uses. A
 * character's model holds every hair style and clothing shape at once;
 * character.c picks the ones that show. Resting pose (no bones yet).
 *
 * Layouts: the 3.3.5a client's (model version 264); see lib/m2.lua for
 * every offset, which this follows exactly.
