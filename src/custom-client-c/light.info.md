light.h (issue 173n) - the zone's light, by place and time of day

For a general audience: the original lights each part of the world by
its own tables. Light.dbc places light spheres on each map (Ashenvale
has its own, as does Astranaar's valley), plus one default per map for
anywhere no sphere reaches. Each light names a parameter set whose
colours (LightIntBand.dbc: the sun's light, the shade's light, five sky
colours from overhead to the horizon, the fog's colour, and more) and
distances (LightFloatBand.dbc: how far the fog ends, and where it
starts) each change through the day: a list of up to 16 (time, value)
pairs, blended between. This reads those tables and answers "what is
the light here, now?".

Layouts (3.3.5a):
  Light: 1 id, 2 map, 3-5 position (x, y, z, all times 36, in
    placement space: world x = 17066.67 - z/36, world y = 17066.67 -
    x/36, height y/36), 6 inner radius, 7 outer radius (times 36), 8
    clear-weather parameter set. A light at position 0, 0, 0 is the
    map's default.
  LightIntBand: 1 id (= set * 18 - 17 + band), 2 count, 3-18 times
    (half-minutes since midnight, 0-2880), 19-34 colours (0xRRGGBB).
    Bands used: 0 sun, 1 shade (ambient), 2-6 sky overhead to horizon,
    7 fog, 14-15 ocean near and deep, 16-17 river near and deep (173r).
  LightFloatBand: 1 id (= set * 6 - 5 + band), 2 count, 3-18 times,
    19-34 values. Band 0: where the fog ends (times 36), band 1: where it
    starts, as a share of that.

Inside a sphere's inner radius its light is used whole; between inner
and outer it blends into whatever lies beyond (the default, or a
larger sphere), by distance.

A LightNow, field by field (colours are red, green, blue, 0 to 1):
  sun[3], shade[3]     the sun's light and the light in shadow
  sky[5][3]            the sky's colours, overhead first, horizon last
  fog[3]               the fog's colour
  water[4][3]          ocean near, ocean deep, river near, river deep
  fog_start, fog_end   float, yards
  sun_dir[3]           a unit vector toward the sun (world axes)
  skybox[128]          the skybox model the strongest light names
                       (LightParams 3 -> LightSkybox 2), "" for none

## What it offers

- `type LightNow`
- `type LightTables`
- `int light_open(LightTables *t, MpqChain *chain, char *why, int why_len);`
- `void light_close(LightTables *t);`
- `int light_at(const LightTables *t, int map, float x, float y, float z, float hours, LightNow *out);`
  The light at world (x, y, z) on map `map` at `hours` since midnight
  (0-24). Returns the id of the light whose colours weigh most (for
  reports), or -1 when the map has no lights at all (then `out` holds a
  plain grey day, and the caller is told).
