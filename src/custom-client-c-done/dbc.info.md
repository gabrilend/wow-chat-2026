# dbc

*Written by `scripts/generate-custom-client-info` from `dbc.h`; don't edit, re-run it.*

dbc.h (issue 173k; the C twin of lib/dbc.lua) - the game's own tables

For a general audience: the client keeps its lists (skin colours, hair
styles, which texture each uses) in simple tables: a header, rows of
equal width, then one block of all the text the rows point into.
Layout: "WDBC", rows, fields a row, bytes a row, bytes of text (uint32
each); then the rows; then the text. Every field here is 4 bytes; the
caller says which are text.

## What it offers

- `type Dbc`
- `int dbc_open(Dbc *d, const unsigned char *s, size_t len, char *why, int why_len);`
- `const char *dbc_text(const Dbc *d, uint32_t row, uint32_t field);`
