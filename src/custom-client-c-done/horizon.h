/*
 * horizon.h (issue 173s) - the far horizon, from the map's low-detail heights
 *
 * For a general audience: besides the full ground files, each map keeps
 * one small file for the whole continent (World\Maps\<map>\<map>.wdl):
 * for every tile a coarse 17 x 17 grid of heights, one every 33 yards. The
 * original draws it beyond the loaded tiles so distant mountains show on
 * the horizon. This draws it out to HORIZON_REACH tiles round her,
 * wherever the full ground isn't loaded, shaded in the fog's colour (so the
 * mountains stand as soft silhouettes against the sky).
 *
 * Layout (3.3.5a): MAOF, 64 x 64 file offsets (tile x * 64 + tile y; 0:
 * none), each to an MARE block: 17 x 17 corner heights then 16 x 16 centre
 * heights (signed 16-bit, yards), rows running south and columns east as
 * in the ground files; then MAHO: 16 rows of 16 hole bits (lowest bit the
 * first column).
