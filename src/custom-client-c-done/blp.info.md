# blp

blp.h (issue 173k; the C twin of lib/blp.lua) - the game's pictures, decoded

For a general audience: every picture painted on a model is a BLP2 file:
the picture at full size and smaller sizes, stored as colour numbers into
a 256-colour palette, as the graphics card's own compressed blocks (DXT1,
DXT3, DXT5: 4 x 4 pixels in 8 or 16 bytes), or as plain pixels. This
turns the full-size picture into plain red-green-blue-alpha bytes.

Header (148 bytes, then a 1024-byte BGRA palette): "BLP2"; at 8 the
encoding (1 palette, 2 DXT, 3 plain); 9 alpha bits; 10 alpha kind (0
DXT1, 1 DXT3, 7 DXT5); 12 width; 16 height; 20 where each size starts
(16 words); 84 how long each is.

## What it offers

- `type BlpImage`
- `int blp_decode(const unsigned char *s, size_t len, BlpImage *out, char *why, int why_len);`
  0 on success; the reason in `why` otherwise.
- `void blp_free(BlpImage *img);`
