/*
 * texture.h (issue 173u) - the game's pictures onto the graphics card
 *
 * For a general audience: most of the game's pictures are stored already
 * compressed in the graphics card's own block format (DXT: 4 x 4 pixels in
 * 8 or 16 bytes), with every smaller copy made in advance. Unpacking them
 * on the processor and sending the plain pixels costs time at load and 4
 * to 8 times the card's memory. This sends compressed pictures as they
 * are, every smaller copy included, and unpacks only the others (palette
 * and plain pictures, as blp.c reads them) and makes their smaller copies
 * on the card. Either way the picture is smoothed between its copies and
 * repeats past its edges.
 *
 * The BLP2 header (blp.h): 8 encoding (2: DXT), 10 alpha kind (0 DXT1,
 * 1 DXT3, 7 DXT5), 12 width, 16 height, 20 where each copy starts (16
 * words), 84 how long each is.
