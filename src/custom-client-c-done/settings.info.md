# settings

*Written by `scripts/generate-custom-client-info` from `settings.h`; don't edit, re-run it.*

settings.h (issue 173b1) - the settings store

For a general audience: every setting the client has (window size,
camera speeds, and later every panel of the Options menu) is declared
once, in one table in settings.c, with its kind, range and default. The
player's changes are kept in one text file shaped like the original
game's WTF/Config.wtf (SET name "value"), holding only what differs
from the defaults. Code reads a setting by name each time it uses it,
so a change takes effect at once, with nothing to rebuild.

Names are the original game's own (its "CVars": cameraYawMoveSpeed,
gxResolution ...) where the setting is the same thing, so the reference
page docs/custom-client-stock-options.md doubles as the list of names to
use. A project setting with no original twin gets a name of its own.

A Setting, field by field:
  decl  the declaration (a SettingDecl in settings.c's table, read-only)
  num   double: the value as a number (toggle 0/1, slider, a numeric
        choice); 0 for text
  text  char[64]: the value as written in the file ("1280x720", "180")

## What it offers

- `type SettingKind`
- `type SettingChoice`
- `type SettingDecl`
- `type Setting`
- `void settings_init(void);`
  Puts every setting at its default. Called once at start, before load.
- `const Setting *settings_find(const char *name);`
  The setting by name, or NULL when there is none.
- `int settings_count(void);`
  How many settings, and the i-th in declaration order (for the menu).
- `const Setting *settings_at(int i);`
- `int settings_set(const char *name, const char *value, char *why, int why_len);`
  Changes a setting. 0 on success; otherwise the value is refused, the
  setting is unchanged, and `why` says why (unknown name, out of range,
  not one of the choices, not a resolution ...).
- `int settings_load(const char *path, FILE *report);`
  Reads the player's file. Each line that names an unknown setting,
  holds a refused value, or isn't `SET name "value"` is written to
  `report` with its line number and skipped. Blank lines and lines
  starting with # are skipped quietly. A missing file is reported once
  and leaves every setting at its default. Returns the number of lines
  skipped for a problem.
- `int settings_save(const char *path, char *why, int why_len);`
  Writes every setting that differs from its default to `path`. 0 on
  success; otherwise `why` says why.
- `double settings_num_at(const char *name, const char *file, int line);`
  The value of a setting, by name. An unknown name is a mistake in the
  code, not in the player's file: it stops the client with the name and
  the file and line asking for it.
- `const char *settings_text_at(const char *name, const char *file, int line);`
- `int settings_resolution(const char *value, int *width, int *height);`
  gxResolution's value split into width and height; 0 on success.
