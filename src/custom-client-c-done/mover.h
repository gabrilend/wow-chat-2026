/*
 * mover.h (issue 173k; the C twin of lib/mover.lua) - how a character moves
 *
 * For a general audience: one step of a character's movement, given what
 * the player is pressing and how much time passed: turning, walking along
 * the ground, falling, jumping, and sliding down ground too steep to
 * stand on. The numbers are the game's own base speeds, times the speed
 * bonus (the owner asked for 120%). No drawing here, so it is tested alone.
 *
 * Facing is the game's: radians, 0 = north (+x), rising toward west (+y).
