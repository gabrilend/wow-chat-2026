prefetch.h (issue 173u) - reading ahead of her, on a second thread

For a general audience: when she walks into a new map tile, the client
loads that tile's ground, buildings and doodads, and most of the time
that takes is unpacking their files out of the game's archives. This
runs a helper thread that is told which tiles she is likely to reach
next (the ring just beyond those loaded) and unpacks their files ahead
of time into the archive reader's memory (mpq.h): the tile's ground
file, each doodad's model and skin and the pictures it names, each
building's root, parts and pictures. When the tile really loads, its
files are already unpacked. When told to, it also prepares each such
tile's ground (ground_prep.h: its points, blend picture, and the
pictures not yet on the card) and keeps it until the main thread takes
it, leaving that thread only the sending to the card. The helper draws
nothing; what it shares with the main thread is the archive reader's
memory and the server's heights (each locked) and its own keeping
(locked here).

## What it offers

- `void prefetch_start(MpqChain *chain, const char *map_name);`
  Starts the helper for map `map_name` (its tiles are
  World\Maps\<map>\<map>_<ty>_<tx>.adt); the chain must outlive it.
- `void prefetch_prepare_ground(const GroundPlace *place, int (*on_card)(const char *name));`
  From now on, each tile read ahead has its ground prepared too, at
  `place` (which must outlive the helper); `on_card` (any thread) says
  which pictures are on the card already, so they aren't unpacked.
- `void prefetch_tile(int tx, int ty);`
  Asks for tile (tx, ty) to be read ahead (once; repeats are ignored).
- `void prefetch_wait(void);`
  Waits until every asked-for tile is read (for the tests and pictures).
- `void prefetch_counts(int *tiles, int *files, int *grounds_made, int *grounds_taken);`
  How many tiles the helper has read ahead, the files it unpacked, the
  grounds it prepared, and how many of those the main thread took.
- `int prefetch_take_ground(int tx, int ty, GroundPrep **out);`
  Takes tile (tx, ty)'s prepared ground, for loading it now: 0 with
  `*out` (the caller sends or frees it); 1 the map has no ground file
  there; 2 not prepared (the caller prepares it itself). Waits if the
  helper is preparing that very tile. Either way the helper won't prepare
  it again until it is forgotten (prefetch_keep_near).
- `void prefetch_keep_near(int tx, int ty, int reach);`
  Forgets every tile more than `reach` tiles from (tx, ty): frees its
  preparation, and lets it be asked for again later.
- `void prefetch_stop(void);`
  Stops the helper (it finishes the tile it is on).
