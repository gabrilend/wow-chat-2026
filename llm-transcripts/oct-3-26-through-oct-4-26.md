## Contents

1. 2026-10-03 11:47, after Request 1 - Your 32-bit Wine prefixes stopped working
   because Wine 11.18 can't run them, so we're downgrading to Wine 10.20 from
   your package cache and holding it. Next, run the two sudo commands I gave
   you, then launch the client.
2. 2026-10-03 11:54, after Request 2 - You're getting the WoW client running
   again on Wine 10.20, and it's lagging because the 32-bit NVIDIA graphics
   libraries are missing. Next, run `sudo xbps-install -S nvidia580-libs-32bit`
   and relaunch the game.
3. 2026-10-03 14:32, after Request 8 - Goal: get new buddies working properly,
   and right now that means finding why Sargobras ignores the clan name. Next,
   type `.reload ale`, try naming the clan with Karson again, and I'll read the
   trace log.
4. 2026-10-03 15:30, after Request 14 - Goal is fixing Mozonn's two-spot
   back-and-forth: the movement trace and starting-kit change are written and
   compile-checked but not built yet. Next, you rebuild and start the server,
   then run `.buddy trace Mozonn` with Constine nearby.
5. 2026-10-03 15:46, after Request 16 - I'm fixing the clan naming with
   Sargobras and making buddy movement sensible. Next: please run .reload ale,
   try Karson's clan name once with the plain-icon test menu, and tell me
   whether to build the navigation-mesh pathfinding option.
6. 2026-10-03 15:55, after Request 17 - We're making buddy bots and Sargobras's
   clan naming work, and the next step is your test. Run .reload ale, then with
   Karson click "First, let me name our clan," type a name and press OK; I'll
   read the trace afterwards.
7. 2026-10-03 16:36, after Request 20 - We're getting buddy bots to walk
   sensibly on the navigation mesh and fixing Sargobras's clan naming; smooth
   turning and pathfinding stages 1–4 are written and compiling. Next,
   rebuild, then test the name box with a new Horde character.
8. 2026-10-03 16:54, after Request 21 - We're fixing how buddy-bots move:
   navmesh pathfinding, smooth turning, climbing or circling for a view, plus
   Sargobras's spoken clan naming with a name-box test. Next: rebuild the
   server, then trace Mozonn and try a Horde character at Sargobras.
9. 2026-10-03 17:20, after Request 24 - We're getting buddies walking, fighting,
   training and clan-naming properly. Spell learning, Sargobras's outfit and the
   town baker are built but untested, so your next step is to rebuild, then run
   scripts/bake-buddy-towns.
10. 2026-10-03 18:05, after Request 27 - We're getting buddies to roam, fight
    and visit towns properly, and I just fixed Carago's fight loop in code.
    Next, rebuild and test, and tell me whether to build the town circles that
    separate a valley's camp from its wilderness.
11. 2026-10-03 18:38, after Request 28 - We're getting buddy bots to roam,
    fight, visit towns and look right. Town circles, Carago's fight fix,
    Sargobras's face and the new entrance are all written but not built. Next:
    rebuild, then test them in game.
12. 2026-10-03 19:02, after Request 29 - Buddies should come back on their own
    after any login, and that fix is written but not built yet. Next, have your
    girlfriend log out normally and back in to bring Olinigo back, then rebuild
    when your live test ends.
13. 2026-10-03 19:26, after Request 31 - We're getting buddy-bots to behave well
    in your live tests; the loot-turns and stay-close-in-danger issues are
    written and waiting on your answers. Next, answer those three questions
    each, and say yes or no to the pacing fix for Marvaria.
14. 2026-10-03 20:59, after Request 32 - You're testing Zul'Farrak with
    Feldowinn and Matis, both level 46, taught their spells, and at the
    entrance. Next, log Feldowinn out and back in to bring Sargobras, and say
    whether to build `.buddy kit` for Matis's gear.
15. 2026-10-03 21:29, after Request 33 - You're preparing Feldowinn and Matis
    for a Zul'Farrak buddy test, with gear, dungeon-follow and kit fixes now in
    code. Next, rebuild the server, then type `.buddy kit Matis` to equip him.
16. 2026-10-03 22:19, after Request 39 - We're fixing and extending the buddy
    bots, and the faulty source patches are now rewritten and all pass their
    check. Next is building NPC awareness, unless you'd rather recompile and
    test first.

### User Request 1

Hi, Wine updated on my system and now I can't run 32 bit prefixes. Can you help
me fix it? The specific program I want to run is the game client for this
project, located at /home/ritz/games/azeroth-core/client/ there's a run file
there. But I also want to know how to fix it so I don't have to re-install ALL
of my wine programs. I use a specific prefix for each program because it feels
more organized if I do it that way.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Assistant Response 1

> Let me see the actual error.

Your prefixes are fine. The new Wine package is what broke. Void's Wine 11.18 is
built in "WoW64-only" mode: it has no 32-bit loader, and 32-bit Windows programs
run inside a 64-bit Wine process that translates their calls. That build refuses
any prefix created with `WINEARCH=win32`. Running your client prefix gives this
error:

```
wine: WINEARCH is set to 'win32' but this is not supported in wow64 mode.
```

Each 32-bit prefix has `#arch=win32` at the top of its `system.reg` and no
`syswow64` folder. Wine 11 can't open that layout, and it has no tool to convert
one in place.

## Fix: go back to the version you had before and lock it

Your package cache still has Wine 10.20, the version that worked. These commands
need root, so run them yourself:

```
! sudo xdowngrade /var/cache/xbps/wine-common-10.20_1.x86_64.xbps /var/cache/xbps/wine-10.20_1.x86_64.xbps /var/cache/xbps/wine-32bit-10.20_1.x86_64.xbps /var/cache/xbps/wine-mono-10.4.1_1.x86_64.xbps
```
```
! sudo xbps-pkgdb -m hold wine wine-32bit wine-common wine-mono
```

The second command puts a hold on the packages, so `xbps-install -Su` skips Wine
from now on. That keeps every per-program prefix working with no reinstalls.
Your client's `run` script doesn't need any changes.

## Later options, most useful first

1. **Keep a second Wine for 32-bit prefixes.** Unpack a standalone build that
   still has a 32-bit loader (for example the non-wow64 "amd64" builds from
   Kron4ek's Wine-Builds on GitHub) into a folder such as `~/programs/wine-32/`.
   Then change the `wine` call in each run script to that folder's `bin/wine`.
   You could then lift the hold and update the system Wine. The old prefixes
   would keep their own runtime, much like each one already keeps its own
   prefix.
2. **Move prefixes to 64-bit one at a time, as you get to them.** Make a fresh
   64-bit prefix (no `WINEARCH`, or `WINEARCH=win64`), copy the program folders
   across from the old `drive_c`, and rerun only the winetricks components that
   program needs. For this client that's cheap: the game files live outside the
   prefix, and 3.3.5a probably doesn't need most of the `--install` list
   (dotnet40, vb6run, speechsdk). The client's `run` script would also need the
   `WINEARCH=win32` line removed or changed to `win64`.
3. **Unhold once Wine can convert old prefixes.** Watch the Void and Wine
   changelogs for support for reading win32-layout prefixes.

To check the downgrade worked, `wine --version` should print `wine-10.20`. Then
start the client with `/home/ritz/games/azeroth-core/client/run`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### User Request 2

okay I downgraded but now the game is running at like, 100% on like 8 of my
CPUs? And it's very laggy, like 1 frame every 3 seconds. It didn't used to run
like this! Even when I had the game and the server running it was never more
than like, 60 or 70% on a couple CPU cores.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Assistant Response 2

The game is drawing every frame in software on your CPU, not on your graphics
card. Here's the chain:

- Your GTX 1080 Ti uses the `nvidia580` driver series. The 64-bit driver
  libraries are installed, but the 32-bit ones (`nvidia580-libs-32bit`) are not.
  The repo has that package; it's just not on your system.
- Wine 10.20 runs WoW as a real 32-bit process. A 32-bit process can only load
  32-bit OpenGL libraries. With NVIDIA's missing, it falls through to Mesa's
  `llvmpipe`, a software renderer that spreads the drawing across all your CPU
  cores. That matches what you saw: about 8 cores pinned and roughly one frame
  every few seconds.
- You probably didn't notice the gap before because Wine 11's WoW64 mode runs
  everything in a 64-bit process, which uses the 64-bit NVIDIA libraries you do
  have. My guess is the 32-bit NVIDIA package fell off when the system moved
  from the old `nvidia` packages (your cache has `nvidia-libs-32bit-595` from
  Sept 30) to the `nvidia580` series. Pascal cards like yours need that older
  series. I couldn't read the package log to confirm, because it needs root.

Fix (needs root):

```
! sudo xbps-install -S nvidia580-libs-32bit
```

Then start the client again. To confirm it's on the GPU, run `nvidia-smi` while
the game is up. `Wow.exe` should appear in its process list.

Other 32-bit programs in your other Wine prefixes have the same problem, so this
fixes them too.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### User Request 3

Okay great. Can you tell me, what's stopping the game from connecting over the
internet now? I have a domain wow.ritzmenardi.com that points toward it I think.
Though I might need to update the name record to my current public IP... I'll go
do that now while you find out the rest of the steps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Assistant Response 3

> Checking your firewall rules next.

The server side is set up correctly. Two things are probably blocking outside
players: the stale DNS record you're already fixing, and router port forwarding,
which I can't see from here.

**Already working on this machine:**
- The login server is listening on port 4362 and the world server on 4462. Both
  accept connections on every network interface, not just this machine.
- Your firewall lets both ports in.
- Every realm in the database gives clients `wow.ritzmenardi.com` as its
  address. The active profile is `basic`.

**What's broken or unknown:**

1. **DNS is out of date.** `wow.ritzmenardi.com` currently points to
   `184.3.201.206`, but your public IP is `97.120.253.166`. Your record update
   fixes this.
2. **Router port forwarding.** Your router (192.168.1.1) needs to forward TCP
   ports **4362 and 4362** — correction: TCP **4362 and 4462** — to
   **192.168.1.100**. Your public IP has changed. If that came with a new router
   or a router reset, the old forwarding rules are probably gone.
3. **This machine's local address could change.** 192.168.1.100 was handed out
   automatically by the router's DHCP, so it can change after a reboot and break
   the forwarding. Reserve that address for this machine in the router's DHCP
   settings.

**Testing it:** once DNS updates, have a friend, or your phone with Wi-Fi off,
check that port 4362 on `wow.ritzmenardi.com` answers. Remote players set their
`realmlist.wtf` to `set realmlist wow.ritzmenardi.com:4362`.

Two notes:
- Keep your own client on `127.0.0.1:4362`. The login server only hands out its
  local address to clients connecting from 127.0.0.1. Anyone else, including
  other computers on your home network, is sent to `wow.ritzmenardi.com`. That
  only works for them if your router supports loopback ("NAT hairpin"), meaning
  it lets a device inside your network reach your own public IP.
- If a remote player can see the realm list but hangs on "Connecting" after the
  DNS change, restart the login server. Then it definitely sends out the new
  address.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### User Request 4

what happens if there's a player on the local network and my router doesn't
support loopback? I seem to remember we can't use custom ports without a dns...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Assistant Response 4

Without loopback on the router, a player on your home network can log in but
can't enter the world. The fix is a one-line change in the database, and you
don't need a second DNS name for it.

**Why it breaks.** The login server picks which world-server address to send
each client (`Realm.cpp:23`). It has three cases:

| Where the client connects from | Address it's sent |
|---|---|
| This machine (127.x) | Its own address back, because your realm's local address is set to 127.0.0.1 |
| Inside the realm's "local network" (local address + subnet mask) | The local address |
| Anywhere else | The public address, `wow.ritzmenardi.com` |

Right now the "local network" is defined as `127.0.0.1` / `255.255.255.0`, which
only covers this machine. A player at, say, 192.168.1.50 falls into "anywhere
else" and is sent to your public IP. Without loopback, the router drops a
connection from inside your network to its own public IP. So that player can log
in (their `realmlist.wtf` can point straight at `192.168.1.100:4362`) and see
the realm list, then hangs on "Connecting" after picking a realm.

**Fix:** point the local address at this machine's address on your home network.

```sql
UPDATE realmlist SET localAddress = '192.168.1.100', localSubnetMask = '255.255.255.0';
```

After that:
- Players on your home network (192.168.1.x) are sent `192.168.1.100:4462` and
  connect directly, without going through the router.
- Your own client on 127.0.0.1 is also sent `192.168.1.100`. The code assumes a
  client on the server machine can reach everything on its own network, and it
  can.
- Outside players still get `wow.ritzmenardi.com`.

This depends on 192.168.1.100 not changing, which is one more reason for the
DHCP reservation. The login server re-reads the realm table every 20 seconds, so
no restart is needed. I haven't run the update; tell me if you want me to.

**About custom ports and DNS:** I can't find anything in this setup that needs a
DNS name for a custom port, and I can't tell where that memory comes from. The
ports are stored in the realm table's `port` column (world, 4462) and in your
`realmlist.wtf` (login, `127.0.0.1:4362`), and both already work with a plain
IP. Do you remember whether that limit came up with the login port in
`realmlist.wtf`, or with the world port the server hands out?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### User Request 5

I mean, in the realmlist.wtf file I thought you couldn't specify a specific port

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Assistant Response 5

The 3.3.5a client does accept a port in `realmlist.wtf`, and your own setup
already depends on it:

- Your file contains `set realmlist 127.0.0.1:4362`.
- The login server listens only on 4362. Nothing is on the client's default
  port, 3724.
- Your account `RITZ` last logged in from 127.0.0.1 on 2026-09-30.

If the client ignored the `:4362`, it would have tried 3724, found nothing
listening, and that login couldn't have happened.

So remote players can use `set realmlist wow.ritzmenardi.com:4362`, and players
on your home network can use `set realmlist 192.168.1.100:4362`.

I don't know where the no-port rule came from. My guess is that it holds for
some other client version, or that it's about the realm table's address field.
That field takes only a host name or IP, and the world port sits in its own
column. I haven't checked either guess.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### User Request 6

I got this error in the chat log after a while, do you know what it means?

MoveSplineInitArgs::Validate: expression 'velocity
> 0.01f' failed for GUID Full: 0xf1300016450009e9 Type: Creature Entry: 5701
> Low: 2537

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Assistant Response 6

It's a harmless rejected movement order. Something told the Undercity NPC Selina
Pickman to walk somewhere at a speed of zero (or almost zero). Before sending
any movement to clients, the server checks that the speed is above 0.01, so it
refused the order and logged it (`MoveSpline.cpp:202`). She just doesn't move,
and nothing else is affected.

**About her** (`acore_world_basic`, entry 5701):
- She's a fixed spawn in Undercity at (1594.5, 129.3, -62.1), spawn ID 41831.
  The "Low: 2537" in the message is a temporary ID handed out while the server
  runs, not the database row.
- Her movement type is 0: she stands still, with no wandering and no patrol
  path.
- Her normal speeds are fine: walk 1.0, run 1.14.
- No script controls her. None of the basic profile's Lua scripts reference her,
  and there are no database event scripts for her.

So her data isn't asking for zero speed. Something at runtime brought her speed
to zero and then asked her to move. These are the usual ways that happens, most
likely first:

1. **Stacked slows reaching -100%.** A slowing effect (snare, frost spell,
   crippling poison, maybe from a bot) brings her speed to 0. Then she tries to
   move: chase someone, or walk back to her spot after leaving combat. That walk
   is the order that gets rejected.
2. **A bot pulling or bumping her.** Playerbots wandering Undercity sometimes
   start combat with city NPCs, and the walk home afterwards can hit the same
   check.
3. **A speed-scaling effect from a module.** I haven't checked whether any
   installed module changes creature speed.

Were you or your buddies anywhere near her (Undercity, Rogues' Quarter area)
when it appeared, and did anything there start a fight? If it only ever names
her, the cause is local to her. If it starts naming other creatures that had
just been in combat, it's the slow-then-walk-home pattern.

One side note: `acore_world_basic` still uses the older column name `id` in its
spawn table, where newer AzerothCore uses `id1`. That's why my first queries
failed. Nothing is wrong with your server.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### User Request 7

alright when I create a new character and talk to Sargobras, I can pick an entry
and enter my guild name, but then I click okay and nothing happens. The chat
window with Sargobras doesn't close either. I can click again and it'll let me
pick another guild name, doesn't seem to do anything. Also, my felicity
character doesn't know any of her abilities! That made me think, can we make it
so that buddy bots start with all of the abilities they should know at their
level?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I haven't found the cause of the clan-name problem yet. I did find a different
bug in the Sargobras script, and the reason buddies don't know their abilities.

## Clan name: what's known

- The server never ran the "you picked something" part of the script. That part
  closes the window as its very first step, and your window stayed open.
  Karson's buddy slot is also still unchosen in the database: class 0, race 0,
  no clan.
- No Lua error is logged for it, so the script didn't crash partway through.
- The script's handler for a typed answer exists, and so does the server path
  that feeds it. Both read correctly.
- Between receiving your click and handing it to the script, the server has
  three places where it drops a click silently, without logging anything:
  1. the option number you clicked isn't in the menu the server remembers for
     you;
  2. the menu belongs to a different NPC than the one you answered;
  3. the server decides you can't interact with Sargobras right now.
- Clans were created successfully on Sept 29 ("configurers", "miargies"). That
  was before the same-day change that put every class and race on one page, and
  the log for that commit says the menu wasn't tested on a live server
  afterwards.

**Next step:** add temporary log lines to the script, so each greeting and each
click records what option number and what NPC the server sees. The Lua engine
reloads scripts without a rebuild (`.reload ale`). Then you click once more and
I read the log, which shows which of the three drops it is. Shall I add them?

Here's what I'd like you to check meanwhile: on a character that already has a
clan, does picking a class *without* the name box work? If it also does nothing,
the problem is the menu itself (most likely the first drop above). If it works,
the problem is specific to the typed-answer route.

## The other bug (unrelated, but it's flooding the log)

The roaming Sargobras who follows you from level 10 calls an "is this creature
moving?" function. The Lua engine version you pinned yesterday only has that
function for players, not creatures. So his follow step fails once a second
while he stands near you: hundreds of `IsMoving (a nil value)` lines in
`logs-basic/Server.log`. As a result he never turns to face you. The engine has
an "is this creature stopped?" function with the opposite meaning, so the fix is
to replace the two calls with its negation. I can do this alongside the log
lines.

## Abilities

**Felicity** isn't a bot. She's your own character, level 44, and the owner of
the five buddy slots. A player character only learns class abilities from a
trainer or from quests. If she reached 44 through a level command, she has never
visited a trainer. Was she levelled that way?

**Buddies** never learn anything on their own. The bot module does have "learn
trainer spells on level-up" and "learn quest spells" switches, and both are on
in your config. But its level-up code checks "is this one of the server's random
bots?" before applying either one (`AutoMaintenanceOnLevelupAction.cpp:67`).
Buddies live on companion accounts, so they fail that check, and the same goes
for talent picking.

Ways to give buddies their abilities, most likely to work first:

1. **A small reversible patch to the bot module** (`patches/B0xx`), the same
   kind as the existing buddy patches. It lets companion-account bots pass that
   "random bot" check, so they learn trainer spells, quest spells and pet spells
   on every level-up. For a buddy made above level 1, it would also run the same
   learning once when the buddy is created. This reuses the bot module's own
   complete spell list. It needs a rebuild, which you'd run.
2. **Lua only, no rebuild.** On a buddy's login and level-up, look up its class
   trainer's spell list in the database and teach each spell its level allows.
   This is quicker to try. But it misses quest-reward spells and pet spells, and
   it depends on the trainer tables being complete for every class.
3. **Leave buddies with only what their owner has learned.** On level-up, teach
   a buddy only the spells its owner has learned (same class only). That ties
   buddy strength to how far you've progressed rather than to level alone. It's
   an unusual design, but it fits the roguelike's "abilities are earned" idea.

Do you want me to go ahead with option 1? Under the project rules it gets its
own issue file (a sub-issue of the buddy-creation issue) before I write it.

he doesn't let you pick a class because I already picked a buddy-bot for level
1. Cannot test.

Also, I started walking around with Constine. Mozonn, his buddy-bot, is behaving
strangly. First, she walks straight to the nearest graveyard, ignoring the
neutral monsters. Also she spawned with a fishing rod, which is not ideal, we
should start level 1 buddy-bots with the same starting equipment that a player
gets. But only for level 1's, otherwise the old algorithm works, where we pick
the best white gear item within the previous 5 levels (but not from level 1 or
without a level requirement, because then you get weird cosmetic gear and
holiday items and such.)

Anyway Mozonn is now walking back and forth between two spots near a graveyard.
Not sure what's up with her.

Might wanna check the logs again.

>   The other bug (unrelated, but it's flooding the log)

This was for the Felicity Sargobras by the way.

Yeah it was a command because I wanted to test the dungeon Uldaman. However,
there's only one Sargobras near her, and she doesn't have her abilities. We need
to spawn a trainer near her, and give her like 50 gold to level those abilities.

this is the best option. We need them to visit trainers when they're in towns.
Also, Mozonn was running, not walking, which might be a clue. Also, we can
manually add the quest-reward spells and pet spells and such to the list of
spells we teach to each class.

I've added the trace. Load it with `.reload ale` (in game as a GM, or typed into
the worldserver console), then try the clan name with Karson once more and I'll
read the log. I also found what's behind Mozonn's roaming and the fishing rod.

## The clan-name trace (added)

The new file is `src/lua-basic/gossip-trace.lua`. It's temporary, and it only
reads copies of the conversation messages without changing anything. It writes
three kinds of `[gossip-trace]` lines to `logs-basic/Server.log`:

- **menu sent:** which NPC the menu came from, how many options it had, and
  which of those options open the name box;
- **answer received:** which NPC and option number your client answered, the
  text you typed, and how far you were from Sargobras;
- **handler reached:** written only if the server passed the click on to the
  Sargobras script.

Comparing the lines tells me which of the three silent drops is happening.

## Mozonn

- **She's walking to Ammen Vale's middle, not to the graveyard.** Roaming picks
  the middle of the area the owner is standing in and circles out from there.
  The stored middle for Ammen Vale is (-4141.5, -13645.9). The Ammen Vale
  graveyard is at (-4123.1, -13660.1), about 23 yards away. That middle was
  computed as the centre of the area's map squares (it was never hand-adjusted),
  and it happened to land beside the graveyard.
- **Back and forth:** the log has one line at the same spot: "found no waypoint
  in area 3526 … roaming paused 10 s". The circling found no clear spot in any
  direction around her and gave up for 10 seconds. My guess is she keeps
  alternating between that failure and a short step. I haven't confirmed it,
  because roaming only logs failures. Seeing every pick would need a log line
  added to the buddy module and a rebuild.
- **Running is intentional.** It's your rule from 2026-09-29: a roaming buddy
  runs outdoors and walks indoors (`buddies_roam_strategy.cpp:537`).
- **Neutral monsters:** I haven't looked into this yet.

## Fishing rod

The kit looks for the best white weapon or armour any vendor sells with a
required level at or below the buddy's level. A fishing pole is a white weapon
with no level requirement, so at level 1 it wins (`buddies_kit.cpp:56`). It also
isn't limited to the last 5 levels, as you described. The change you want:

- level 1 gets the player starting outfit for that race and class;
- above level 1 gets the best white item with a required level from (level −
  4) to level, never 0 or 1.

This change is in the buddy module (C++), so it needs a rebuild, which you'd
run. It also changes the design in the starting-kit issue, so I'd update that
issue first.

## Felicity

She's a level-44 Blood Elf warlock with 0 money, standing near Uldaman. As GM,
in game:

```
.npc add temp 16646
.modify money 500000
```

16646 is Alamma, a Silvermoon warlock trainer. `temp` means she isn't saved to
the database and is gone after a restart. Run `.modify money` with no target
selected (or yourself selected); 500000 copper is 50 gold.

## Buddy abilities: questions before I write the issue

1. **When do they learn?** You said "visit trainers when they're in towns".
   Should buddies learn **only** when their town visit reaches a trainer? Or
   automatically on level-up, with the trainer visit only as flavour? Learning
   only in town means a buddy can lag behind until you pass through a town.
2. **Who pays?** Trainers charge. Should a buddy pay from its own money (the kit
   gives 1 silver per level, nothing at level 1), or learn for free?
3. **A buddy made above level 1 (from a level-10+ Sargobras):** should it start
   knowing everything up to its level, or wait for its first town?

Separately: can I fix the roaming Sargobras's `IsMoving` crash now? It's a
two-line change to the Sargobras script and doesn't need a rebuild.

Okay Felicity needs to learn her quest spells too, can you teach the ones that a
level 44 would know to her?

they can't lag behind because that's also when the player can learn new spells,
so... they'll always be roughly equivalent. Just on town visits, and only if
there's a trainer in that town.

It's own money. If it gets to the trainer and realizes it doesn't have enough
money, it should mark the task as complete. It should learn the lowest cost
spells first.

Everything up to it's level.

# Issue lifecycle

The owner's CLAUDE.md is the authority on what issue files are for and what
they must contain; where it and this skill ever disagree, CLAUDE.md wins. This
skill adds the mechanics CLAUDE.md leaves open: which tools answer which
question, in what order, and what to do when a tool says no.

All tools live in one place and are called by absolute path:

| Tool | Answers |
|---|---|
| `/home/ritz/programming/ai-stuff/scripts/validate-issues <project>` | is the issue tree consistent; next free number per phase |
| `validate-issues <project> --next <phase>` | the number to give a new issue |
| `validate-issues <project> --file <issue>` | is this one issue well-formed and are its links matched |
| `/home/ritz/programming/ai-stuff/scripts/progress-dashboard.lua <project> -m` | done/open counts per phase (for progress files and demos) |
| `/home/ritz/programming/ai-stuff/scripts/commit-own-changes <repo> -F -` | commits exactly the lines this session wrote, plus the changed transcripts of the commit's projects (any conversation's), and runs the repository's commit hooks, without touching the shared staging area |
| `/home/ritz/programming/ai-stuff/scripts/stage-own-changes <repo>` | previews what that commit would take; writes nothing |
| `/home/ritz/programming/ai-stuff/scripts/claim-own-change <file>` | records lines this session changed by a route the edit ledger cannot see (see Committing) |
| `/home/ritz/programming/ai-stuff/scripts/adopt-left-behind-changes <repo> -- <path>...` | takes ownership, line by line, of uncommitted work a finished session left, leaving lines any other session still holds (see Committing) |

Each tool has a `.info.md` beside it; read that rather than the source.

## Before writing a new issue

1. **Search first, including `issues/completed/`.** Grep the issue tree for
   the feature's nouns, not just the likely title. A completed issue about the
   same machinery is reopened and extended rather than duplicated: history is
   more useful stacked vertically in one file than spread across several.
2. **Pick the phase by what the work builds on**, not by when it is being
   done. Lower numbers are foundations; later issues depend on earlier ones.
3. **Take the number from the tool:** `validate-issues <project> --next
   <phase>`.
   It reads the project's own naming shape (522, 1001, 9-007, A04) and never
   reuses a number that a completed file already holds.
4. **Write the blueprint** with the three sections CLAUDE.md requires, plus
   link fields in the shape the project already uses (look at a neighbour).
   Name related functions, structures and files instead of pasting code.
5. **Check it:** `validate-issues <project> --file <new-issue>`, and fix what it
   reports on the new file. If the new issue blocks or is blocked by others,
   add the matching line to the other side too.

## While working

- Keep **Current Behavior** true. It is the only section that changes while
  an issue is in progress; rewrite it in place rather than appending a log.
- A question that surfaces is written into the issue (an "Open questions"
  section) and then asked. An issue with an unanswered question is in
  progress, not done.
- Anything discovered that changes another issue's assumptions is written into
  that issue now, not at completion.

## Splitting into sub-issues

Split when an issue holds work streams that could be built, tested or reviewed
separately, or when it cannot be finished in one sitting. Do not split an issue
that is already one mechanism. When splitting, produce and then write out:

1. **A table** — `| ID | Name | Dependencies | Description |`, where ID is the
   parent number plus a lower-case letter (103a, 103b), Name is dash-separated
   lower-case words, Dependencies is "None" or sibling IDs.
2. **The rationale** — the distinct work streams, why one issue cannot hold
   them, what splitting buys.
3. **The execution order** — a small dependency graph, e.g.
   `103a (foundation) → 103b (needs 103a) → 103c (parallel with 103b)`.

Each row becomes a file `{parent}{letter}-{name}.md` with the three sections.
The parent keeps its blueprint and gains a short list of its sub-issues; the
analysis itself is not appended to the parent (that would be worklog, not
blueprint). Run `validate-issues` afterwards: it reports orphaned sub-issues
and one-sided links.

## Completing an issue

An issue is complete only when nothing in it is deferred and no open question
is unanswered. Then, in this order:

1. **Run the project's tests.** A fixed bug gets a test that would have caught
   it.
2. **Rewrite the issue as the blueprint of what was built**: Current Behavior
   states the built system; steps name the real functions and files; decisions
   not taken are stated with their reason. Poetry the owner wrote during the
   work goes into the issue verbatim.
3. **Move it** into `issues/completed/` (`git mv`, so the history follows).
4. **Update `issues/phase-<N>-progress.md`** for that phase. Take counts from
   `progress-dashboard.lua <project> -m`, or better, name the command instead
   of copying numbers that will go stale.
5. **Update related issues** whose Current Behavior or assumptions changed.
6. **Run `validate-issues <project>`** and fix new findings that the change
   caused. Findings older than the change are reported to the owner, not
   silently fixed in passing.
7. **Commit** as below.

## Committing

The rule (CLAUDE.md): a commit carries exactly the lines this session wrote —
never another session's work, even if it sits in the same file — and every
changed transcript of the commit's projects rides along — the session's own
project folder and the projects of the files it commits — this
conversation's and any other's left behind (a session that committed, talked
on and quit), so each project's story in git stays whole.

Commit small and often: each piece as soon as it is done and checked, not a
pile at the end.

1. Optionally preview: `stage-own-changes <repo>` lists what would be taken
   and what left out, and writes nothing.
2. Commit: `commit-own-changes <repo> -F -` with the message on standard
   input. It builds the commit on a private staging list from this session's
   own lines (the edit ledger the edit hook keeps) plus those transcripts, and
   never touches the shared staging area, so nothing another
   session has staged can ride along. Plain `git commit` is refused by the
   commit gate.
3. Message style: say what the software now does, in plain English and by
   mechanism or analogy; mention any extra changes and why. No function names.

**When it stops or leaves something out.**

- **A tangled ("mixed") block** means another session changed lines right
  next to or on top of yours. Nothing is committed. Tell the owner which file
  and line; decide together what that region should say. `--leave-mixed`
  commits your other blocks meanwhile.
- **Lines that are yours but were written by a route the ledger could not see**
  (a script you ran, a generator, `sed`, a rename): record them with
  `claim-own-change <file>` and say so in the commit message.
- **Nothing to commit, but the work is there**: an earlier session wrote it
  and ended, or the machine rebooted and emptied the ledgers. Look first with
  `adopt-left-behind-changes <repo> --dry-run -- <path>...`, then adopt and
  commit one batch at a time with `commit-own-changes <repo> -F - --
  <path>...`. Lines reported as **held** belong to another session. Take them
  (`--from <session>`) only if that session has finished, and ask the owner
  if unsure. Say in the commit message that the work was adopted and from
  whom. This is the route for a left-behind backlog, not the token.
- **A warning about the shared staging area** means someone had staged that
  file by hand in a way that overlaps your commit; their entry was left alone.
  Tell the owner.

The one-time permission tokens (`/tmp/claude-allow-*`) belong to the person.
Never create one; if a gate names a token, relay the gate's message and let
the owner decide.

## Open questions

- Phase ≥ 10 in compact names depends on the project's issue-number width;
  `validate-issues` decides it from evidence (progress files, `phase-N-demo`
  names). A project with none of those gets a warning. Should the house rule
  fix one width (two digits, as in the 522 example) for every new project?

Felicity's quest spells and the starting-kit change are done. The clan-name
trace needs one more `.reload ale` and one more try with Karson, because the
first version didn't log anything usable.

## Done

- **Felicity:** taught Summon Voidwalker, Summon Succubus and Summon Felhunter
  (the demons from the warlock "Binding" quests at levels 10, 20 and 30), using
  the project's GM command script. She already knew Imp and Felsteed. No other
  warlock quest spell is available below level 50.
- **Roaming Sargobras fix:** the two "is he moving?" checks now use the "is he
  stopped?" function, which this engine version has for creatures. It takes
  effect on the same `.reload ale` and should end the flood of `IsMoving` errors
  in the log.
- **Starting kit:** a level-1 buddy now keeps the starting outfit the game gives
  a new player of its race and class. Above level 1, the kit picks the best
  white vendor item with a required level from (level − 4) to level, never 0
  or 1. The change is in the buddy module, so it needs your rebuild; I haven't
  compiled it. I updated the starting-kit issue to match.
  - Number of white vendor items in the window: level 2 has 2, level 5 has 55,
    level 44 has 9, level 70 has 31, and **level 80 has 0**, because white
    vendor gear stops at level 75. A level-80 buddy would keep its stock items
    in every slot, and it would no longer log "wears nothing chosen for it",
    because those stock items count as worn.
  - No test covers the new window yet. I'll add one before closing the issue.

## Clan-name trace: needs another reload

The first try didn't produce a reading. One line errored (the message size comes
back as a different number type than I expected). The other lines went to the
worldserver console instead of a file, because the Lua engine's `print` only
reaches the console. Both are fixed: the trace now writes to
`tmp/shared-memory/gossip-trace.log`. Please `.reload ale` again and try the
clan name with Karson once more.

## Mozonn: you were right, the neutral monsters explain it

Every monster in Ammen Vale (Vale Moth, Volatile Mutation, Root Lasher, Blood
Elf Scout, both Owlkin) is neutral: yellow, and never attacks first. Roaming
only steers a buddy toward monsters that are hostile and attack on sight.
Free-attacking anything nearby ("grind") is switched off for buddies, by your
decision on Sept 27. So in a neutral-only area, a buddy has nothing to steer
toward and nothing ever attacks it. Mozonn walked to the area's middle (next to
the graveyard) and wandered back and forth around it. Starting zones are mostly
neutral monsters, so this will happen to every new clan. I wrote this into the
creatures-and-chests issue.

**How should a buddy choose a neutral monster to attack?** Some options, most
likely to work first:
1. Treat a neutral monster worth experience like a hostile one for the steering,
   and attack it on arrival, within the same 60-yard look-around roaming already
   does.
2. Attack only neutral monsters the owner is fighting or has recently fought in
   this area: "fight what the owner fights".
3. Let each buddy choose its own target: the closest neutral monster in its
   current direction of travel, at most one fight per waypoint.

## Buddy spells: new issue, not built yet

The town visit **already** has a class-trainer errand in the buddy module, paid
from the buddy's own money. So your design is mostly a change to that C++ code
rather than a Lua script, and it needs a rebuild. I wrote it up as a new
buddy-bots sub-issue, "buddy spell learning"
(`issues/617n-buddy-spell-learning.md`):
- In a town with a class trainer, learn the cheapest lessons first. The first
  lesson it can't afford ends the errand.
- Quest-reward and pet spells come from a list generated from the world
  database's class quests, taught free at the same trainer visit.
- A buddy made above level 1 learns everything up to its level, free, when it's
  made.
- Nothing is learned on level-up between towns.

Three open questions in that issue, before I build it:
1. Should what's learned at creation be free even at level 1? This barely
   matters today, because there's nothing to learn at level 1.
2. Should a hunter buddy made above level 10 already have a pet, or tame one
   itself out in the world?
3. When a buddy runs out of money at the trainer, should it say anything, or is
   a log line enough? The town visit's rule so far is no chat.

Nothing is committed yet.

Yes.

It should start with one randomly. Everytime the player respecs, they should
pick a new pet and get it instantly. They don't need to tame their pets, let's
say.

don't even need a log line except for debug to make sure it works, it should be
a normal occurence.

> Recording your answers in the buddy-spells issue.

Your in-game move only reached the running server's memory, so it isn't saved
yet. One `.reload ale` from you, with Felicity still near the Uldaman pair,
fixes that and also loads the other two script changes.

That one reload does three things:
1. **Reads where the Uldaman Crystal-Keeper and Gemcutter stand right now.**
   Their database rows still hold the generated spots, so a restart would put
   them back. The new temporary reader writes their live positions to
   `tmp/shared-memory/jeweler-spots.log`. It only finds creatures within 300
   yards of an online player.
2. **Starts the clan-name trace**, logging to
   `tmp/shared-memory/gossip-trace.log`. Then try the clan name with Karson
   once.
3. **Loads the roaming Sargobras fix.**

**Saving the jeweler spots:** those spots are written into their SQL file by a
generator, which works them out from landmarks. After the reload, I'll add a
"placed by hand" setting for the Uldaman pair to that generator and re-run it.
That updates the SQL file the install uses (and the reinstall after a fresh
setup). I'd also update the two live database rows, so the next restart already
uses the new spots.

**Placing things:** thanks. Nothing needs placing right now. Keeping Felicity
where she is is exactly what the reader needs. I'll ask when something comes up.

## Sargobras's outfit

I added your look to his appearance issue:

| Slot | Item |
|---|---|
| Back | Cape of the Black Baron |
| Chest | Black Mageweave Vest |
| Shirt | Orange Mageweave Shirt |
| Legs | Black Tuxedo Pants |
| Feet | Dress Shoes |

Face: skin 7, face 8, bald, hair colour 1, bearded.

Two things to decide:
- **Race:** the screenshots don't show it, and face shape, eyebrows and eye
  colour don't exist in the 3.3.5 client. Human male, as in your original
  sketch?
- **How to show it without a client patch:** an NPC's look is normally baked
  into the client's own data files, so a custom outfit would need a client
  patch, and you ruled those out until the custom client exists. But the 3.3.5
  client already has a way around this, used for the mage spell Mirror Image.
  For a creature flagged as a "mirror image", the client asks the server what it
  looks like, and the server answers with race, skin, face, hair, beard and the
  display of every worn item. Today the server only answers for mage copies. A
  small reversible source patch could have it answer with Sargobras's fixed
  outfit. Shall I write that up as the route? It needs a rebuild.

## Neutral monsters: how option 1 differs from grind

The bot module's grind takes any monster worth experience within 100 yards that
it can see, and walks straight to it. Roaming is suspended until the fight ends,
so the buddy beelines from target to target across the area.

Option 1 keeps roaming in charge. It only looks within 60 yards, and it bends
the next leg of the circuit through the monster rather than abandoning it. After
the fight, the circuit continues from where it was.

One detail: hostile monsters are steered toward using their own aggro radius
(how close you can get before they attack). Neutral monsters never attack first,
so they have no such radius. I'd use a fixed reach instead. How about 20 yards,
the base aggro radius for a monster of the buddy's level?

## Mozonn's two spots

Two fixed spots 5 yards apart points to two behaviours taking turns, not to
roaming wandering. Her log has a hint: every few seconds the bot module's "add
gathering loot" action fails. A guess I haven't checked: the chest-and-node
detour walks her toward something she could open, then hands over to the bot
module's own gathering, which fails and gives the object up, so the detour walks
her back toward it. I'll look at what the detour logs at debug level before
claiming that.

## Buddy spells

Your three answers are in the buddy spell learning issue:
- what's learned at creation is free at every level, including level 1;
- a hunter buddy gets a random pet when made, and a new one instantly on every
  owner respec, with no taming;
- running out of money at the trainer is normal, so it gets a debug-level log
  line only.

None of these changes are committed yet.

we should dynamically calculate the radius, and steer the buddy-bot to the edge
of that circle. It'll be different depending on the bot level and the monster
and maybe some other things. Then they should start casting spells or charging
in to fight or stealthing up or whatever the class the buddy-bot is does. Once
the monster is slain, they continue on their circuit.

question... Are we dynamically calculating the pathfinding? Would it make more
sense to like, "bake" pathfinding into the system, maybe with like a djikstra
heatmap style thing, so that we just have to do a couple simpler calculations?
That's for another session, but just curious what you think.

What should we do about Mozonn?

I saved the Uldaman jewelers' new spots, and both are in Sargobras's appearance
issue. Mozonn's back-and-forth is still unexplained, and the clan-name trace is
waiting for your next try with Karson (its log is still empty).

## Uldaman jewelers: saved

- Crystal-Keeper: (-6069.84, -2963.40), facing 1.587. Gemcutter: (-6070.53,
  -2947.52), facing 4.779. Both at height 209.78, read from the live world.
- The jeweler generator now takes hand-placed spots for Uldaman, and these win
  over the spot it works out from the landmark. I re-ran it. In the SQL the
  install uses, only the two Uldaman rows changed; the Uldum and Un'Goro pairs
  are untouched.
- I also wrote the same values into the two live database rows, so the next
  restart already uses them.
- The one-time reader is retired: renamed to `jeweler-spot-reader.lua-done` so
  it no longer loads. Per your rule it gets removed after it has been in one
  commit.

## Sargobras's outfit and neutral monsters: recorded

- Sargobras: human male confirmed, in his appearance issue. Showing the outfit
  through the "mirror image" route still waits for your go-ahead, since it's a
  source patch.
- Neutral monsters: your design is in the creatures-and-chests issue. The buddy
  works out a radius for each monster, steers to the edge of that circle, opens
  the fight the way its class does, then carries on its circuit. That still
  leaves one question: what goes into the radius besides the buddy's and the
  monster's levels? Two candidates to start with:
  - the monster's own melee reach;
  - the buddy's opening range: about 30 yards for a caster's pull spell, a
    charge's range for a warrior, close for a rogue opening from stealth.

## Mozonn

I don't know the cause yet, and I've ruled one guess out. If the chest-and-node
detour had been walking her to something and giving up, it would have logged a
"gave up its detour" warning, and there's none. That leaves two things taking
turns at moving her, and roaming logs nothing while it works, so I can't tell
which from here.

What I'd do, most useful first:

1. **A per-buddy trace in the buddy module**, switched on with a GM command (for
   example `.buddy trace Mozonn`). It logs every waypoint picked, every walking
   leg sent, and which behaviour gave each movement order. Then you log in
   Constine, let Mozonn ping-pong for half a minute, and the log shows both
   spots and who sends her to each. It needs a rebuild.
2. **Build the neutral-monster steering first.** Ammen Vale would then give her
   something to do, which might hide the ping-pong without fixing it. I'd rather
   find it first.
3. **Note the two spots yourself:** stand on each and run `.gps`. That tells us
   whether they sit on a path the planner drew, near a chest or node, or right
   at the area's middle. It's cheap and needs no code, but it only narrows the
   search.

Shall I write the trace (option 1)?

## Baked pathfinding

The system already does some of both.
- **Calculated per trip:** every walking leg is planned when it's needed, on the
  server's navigation mesh, which the bot module searches with A*. Each search
  takes well under a millisecond.
- **Baked once per area:** the exploring grid. Ammen Vale took half a second:
  30,626 walkable cells of 3 yards, 21 rooms, 102 tunnels.

A Dijkstra heatmap on that grid is a "distance to X" number written into every
walkable cell, so each step just moves to the neighbouring cell with the lower
number. It pays off when many buddies walk to the **same few places** over and
over: the area's middle, docks, trainers, town errand spots. One map costs about
72,000 cells × 4 bytes, roughly 290 KB per destination per area.

It would also fix a real failure. The circling roam needs a straight line of
sight to the area's middle, and the "found no waypoint" error fires when there
isn't one. A distance-to-middle heatmap gives a walkable "toward the middle"
direction from anywhere, round walls included.

For one-off destinations (a monster, a random waypoint), per-trip search stays
cheaper than baking a map you use once.

Which destinations do you picture buddies returning to most often? That list is
what decides whether baking is worth it.

None of this is committed yet.

so, the world is static and baked with it's navmeshes and such. I'm thinking
pathfinding between areas, pathfinding in towns, and other similar places could
use a baked pathfinding map. Then, when we're fighting monsters or chasing down
dynamically moving NPCs or other such things, then we'd do path-based
calculations with straight-line paths updated every half-second or so, and
lerping the orientation to the intended direction over 2/5ths of a second.

I wrote the Mozonn trace and it compiles. It needs your rebuild before you can
use it.

## Mozonn trace

After the rebuild and a server start:
1. Log in Constine near Ammen Vale, so Mozonn appears.
2. As GM: `.buddy trace Mozonn`
3. Let her ping-pong for about 30 seconds, then `.buddy trace off`.
4. Tell me, and I'll read `logs-basic/Playerbots.log`.

What it writes, as lines starting `Mozonn TRACE`, sitting between the bot log's
own "which action ran" lines:
- every half second: where she is, whether she's moving, where her current
  movement ends, and which kind of movement holds her (point, follow, chase,
  idle);
- a line every time that destination changes, with the distance from the
  previous one. Two spots taking turns will show up as alternating lines about 5
  yards apart;
- from roaming: each waypoint picked, and whether the circling roam or the
  exploring grid chose it; each walking leg ordered, and whether the bot module
  accepted it; each detour started or ended; each meal started.

I checked all three changed module files (the trace, the roaming file, and the
starting kit) with a syntax-only compile using the real build's flags. To make
sure that check catches errors, I planted a bad line, which it caught. They
haven't been built into the server or run.

## Uldum

The same reader works anywhere. Move the Uldum pair where you want them, stay
nearby, and tell me. I'll switch the reader back on, you `.reload ale`, and I'll
write the spots into the generator the same way as Uldaman.

## Mirror image

It's a trick for giving Sargobras your outfit without changing the game client.

Normally an NPC's whole look (body, face, hair, clothes) is one picture the
client already has on disk, chosen by a number. No existing picture shows a
bald, bearded human in the Black Baron's cape over an orange shirt, and adding
one means patching the client.

The mage spell **Mirror Image** solves this. It makes copies of the mage, and
the client can't know in advance what each mage is wearing. So when the client
sees a creature marked "mirror image", it asks the server what it looks like.
The server answers with race, skin, face, hair, beard and each worn item, and
the client draws that. A small source patch could make the server answer that
question for Sargobras with your outfit, and the client would draw him that way
with no client change.

## Aggro radius: yes, it's in the server, and it already works for neutral monsters

The formula is `Creature::GetAggroRange` (`Creature.cpp:3391`):
- **Start:** the monster's detection range from its database row (most monsters:
  20 yards).
- **Level difference:** subtract 1 yard for each level the buddy is above the
  monster, and add 1 yard for each level it's below. The "below" side stops at
  25 levels.
- **Auras:** add any aura on the monster that widens its detection, and any aura
  on the buddy that changes how far away it's noticed.
- **Clamp:** at most 45 yards, at least 5.

The server's "should I attack this player?" check (`Creature.cpp:1928`) adds the
monster's combat reach to that radius, and only that check skips neutral
monsters. The radius function itself works for any monster. So steering to "the
edge of the circle" for a neutral monster needs no new formula: call the same
function and steer to that distance.

## Baked paths for fixed places, live paths for moving targets

I agree with the split, and I saved your words in the roaming issue for another
session. Two notes for then:
- Paths between areas and through towns repeat, so they're the best fit for
  baked maps. The roaming code's "no line of sight to the middle" failure would
  go away too.
- Straight-line chasing updated every half second is fine in open ground. Near
  walls it needs a cheap "is the straight line clear?" check on the navigation
  mesh, falling back to a real path search when it isn't. Otherwise a chaser
  runs into the wall between it and its target.

One more thing: the roaming issue's status line still says "Nothing runs in game
yet", which is stale, since roaming does run in game. That was already the case
before today. Shall I bring that status section up to date?

Nothing is committed yet.

### User Request 15

mozonn just walked through a wall... now she's just standing around.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Assistant Response 15

> You've already rebuilt and started the trace. Reading it.

The trace explains why she's standing still. It also points to a likely cause
for the wall: a planned path point off the ground she can walk on.

## Why she's standing still

Roaming plans a path as a chain of points (75 here, over 57 yards). It counts a
point as passed when she comes within 2 yards of it, and keeps a bookmark at the
first point not yet passed. Each tick it orders her toward a point up to 8 yards
further along the chain from that bookmark.

The trace shows the bookmark stuck on a point she never got within 2 yards of.
Meanwhile the "8 yards further" target is a point she's already standing on, 0.0
yards away:

```
at (-4133.5, -13760.7) standing by "idle"
roam: leg to path point 74 of 75 (-4133.5, -13760.7), 0.0 yards, refused by the bot module's walking
```

The bot module won't walk somewhere she already is, so the order is refused
every tick. The bookmark never moves, and the waypoint (0.8 yards away) is never
declared reached. She stands there forever. Nothing in the code gives up on a
stuck point.

The same thing happened just before, at path point 2 of 3, (-4096.5, -13717.8).
That point sat 2.7 yards higher than the ground beside it, and the walking ended
4.1 yards short of it. A point she can't get within 2 yards of stalls her the
same way. I think that's the earlier ping-pong too: two points the walking can't
quite reach, taking turns. I haven't confirmed that; this trace caught the
stall, not a ping-pong.

## The wall

Her first leg in the trace was one straight 53-yard run. The positions sampled
every half second lie on a straight line from start to end. The point she was
sent to was 2.7 yards above the ground she ended on, so probably on rock or a
wall rather than walkable ground. When the server's path search can't find a
route to a spot off the walkable ground, it falls back to a straight line,
through whatever is in the way.

So the likely cause is that the planner put a path point somewhere not walkable,
and the leg to it was far longer than the usual 8 yards. I haven't proven this.
The trace started mid-path, so I can't see how that 3-point path was planned.

## Proposed fix (needs your go-ahead and a rebuild)

1. **Count every point she's reached as passed.** If she's within 2 yards of any
   point further along the path, everything up to that point is behind her. This
   ends today's stall directly.
2. **Give up on a stuck point.** If the walking refuses the order, she isn't
   moving, and the bookmarked point still isn't reached for 3 seconds, skip that
   point. If it was the last one, the waypoint counts as reached and roaming
   picks the next. No point can hold her forever.
3. **Keep path points on walkable ground.** Before a leg is ordered, ask the
   server's navigation mesh for the nearest walkable spot to the point. If that
   spot is more than about 1 yard away, use the walkable spot instead, and log
   it in the trace. This targets the wall: no order would go to a spot the path
   search can't reach.

Points 1 and 2 are bookkeeping, so I'd put them in the pure roaming core, which
has no server code. That way the existing offline tests can check them with a
planted stuck point. Point 3 needs the server's map, so it goes in the
server-side roaming file.

Shall I make all three?

she walked down a hill, which is normal and fine. But then she walked through a
wall.

Can you iterate on this until you get something sensible? Maybe think about how
other games do pathfinding at similar scales and try to borrow an approach from
them, or at least, describe it to me so we can work through which one would be
best?

Test is ready. Now the pathfinding write-up.

The clan name: the trace found it, and it isn't the server. The wall: I found
the line of server code that walks through walls.

## Clan name: the client never sends your answer

- Karson's menu went out with 14 options, each with the name box.
- After you pressed OK, **no answer arrived at the server at all**. A few
  minutes earlier, Constine's ordinary click on another NPC arrived fine.
- So the game client swallows it. You have only the stock Blizzard interface, so
  it isn't an addon.

**Suspect: the icons.** The clan that worked on Sept 29 at 13:14 came from a
menu where every option had the plain chat-bubble icon. The per-class and
per-people icons were added at 14:13 that day. The client gives some icons their
own meaning (vendor bag, flight wings, trainer book, tabard), and may handle a
click on those differently.

I've made a temporary A/B test: the same menu with only chat bubbles. Please
`.reload ale` and try Karson once more.
- If it works, the icons are the cause. We'd keep only icons that work with the
  name box, or show the icons only once the clan is named (the box disappears
  then).
- If it still fails, I'll set up the next test.

## The wall: the server's fallback is a straight line

Each leg goes to the server's point movement (`PointMovementGenerator.cpp`,
about line 62). It asks the navigation mesh for a path. **If the mesh finds no
path, it moves the unit in a straight line instead, through anything in
between.** The mesh tiles for Ammen Vale are present and loaded, so the mesh
itself works. What fails is a destination it can't route to: a planned point on
top of a rock or crystal, inside the crash-site wreckage, or 2.7 yards above the
ground, like the one in your trace.

The root problem is that **two models of the world disagree**:
- The roaming planner judges ground from the terrain height map and its own
  3-yard grid. That height map has no walls, rocks, crystals or wreckage; the
  ground layer doesn't include them.
- The server's walking uses the navigation mesh, which does include them.

The planner happily picks points the walking can't reach. The walking then
either stops short (her standing still) or gives up and goes straight (the
wall).

## How other games do it, best fit first

1. **Navigation mesh as the only judge of "walkable"** (Unreal, Unity and most
   3D games, all built on Recast/Detour, the same library WoW servers use).
   - The mesh is a set of polygons covering every spot a character can stand.
   - "Can I go there?" means "is there a polygon there, connected to mine?",
     answered by an A* search over polygons.
   - The AI never chooses where to step. It chooses a *goal*, asks the mesh for
     the nearest real spot to it, and follows the corners of the returned path.
   - For us, the circling roam keeps deciding *which direction and how far*, the
     mesh decides *the exact spot and the route*, and a "no path" answer means
     "pick another goal", never "walk straight".
   - This alone would fix both of today's bugs. The mesh is already loaded; we'd
     just stop overriding it.

2. **Hierarchical paths: a coarse map of rooms, then the mesh inside a room**
   (HPA*, used in Dragon Age and many RPGs).
   - Your exploring grid already finds rooms and tunnels: Ammen Vale has 21
     rooms and 102 tunnels.
   - Crossing an area becomes "room A → tunnel → room B" on a small graph,
     then mesh paths inside each room.
   - Cheap for long trips, and matches how a person thinks about a town ("go to
     the square, then the inn").

3. **Flow fields / Dijkstra maps** (strategy games: Supreme Commander 2,
   Planetary Annihilation, *They Are Billions*). This is your baked idea.
   - One precomputed "distance to the goal" number per cell. Every walker just
     steps downhill, so many walkers share one map for free.
   - Best for fixed shared goals: town errand spots, area borders, docks.
   - Each map has to be computed on the mesh, not on terrain height, or it
     inherits today's problem.

4. **Waypoint graphs** (older MMOs, including Blizzard's own creature patrols,
   Half-Life's node graph).
   - Hand-placed or generated points with known-good links between them; A* over
     a small graph.
   - Very cheap and predictable, but someone or something has to author the
     graph, and it looks "on rails".

5. **Steering with a live line check** (Craig Reynolds' steering behaviours;
   local avoidance like RVO, used for crowds). This is your idea for chasing.
   - Re-aim at a moving target every half second and turn smoothly.
   - Before each straight step, ask the mesh "is this straight line clear?" (a
     raycast along the mesh, a few microseconds). If not, fall back to a real
     path search.
   - That check is the missing piece that would stop chasing through walls.

## What I'd do

Option 1 now, because it fixes both bugs. Then options 2 and 3 for long trips
and towns, as your baked layer, and option 5 for fights. Concretely, for option
1:
1. The circling roam picks a direction and distance as now. Each waypoint and
   path point is then moved to the nearest mesh spot; if there's none within a
   few yards, that pick is dropped.
2. A leg is ordered only if the mesh returns a complete path. "No path" or
   "partial path" means pick again, never walk straight.
3. A point counts as passed once she's within reach of it or of any point
   further along, and a point that makes no progress for 3 seconds is skipped.
   That ends today's stall.
4. The trace logs the mesh's answer for each leg, so the next oddity shows up in
   the log.

Do you want option 1 built that way? Or would you like to go through the others
first? Option 2 is the one that reuses the most of what already exists.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### User Request 17

still didn't work with Karson after a .reload ale. Also, what happens if that
guild name already exists?

So... Why don't we plan with the same navmesh that we're going to walk with?

I think your suggestions for pathfinding sound great. That's a lot of code, do
you think you can handle it succinctly and comprehensively?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Assistant Response 17

The Karson answer packet still never arrives, so the icons weren't it. A second
test is ready. On "why don't we plan with the navmesh": we should, and the
reason we didn't was an early design choice, not anything the server forced.

## Clan name: test 2

Every working clan was named from a box on a **second** page, opened by a plain
option. Now the box sits on the **first** page the greeting sends. So with no
clan yet, Sargobras now shows an extra plain option, **"First, let me name our
clan."** It opens a page holding only the name box.

Please `.reload ale` and try with Karson:
1. Click "First, let me name our clan.", type a name, press OK.
2. If that works, pick a class. That pick has no box any more, which tests the
   plain route too.

## If the name is already taken

- Sargobras says one of his "taken" jokes, and no clan is made.
- **But the buddy pick still goes through.** The class is chosen before the name
  is checked, so a taken name doesn't cost a pick; it only leaves you without a
  clan.
- The next pick asks for a name again.

There's a hole, though. Once every owed buddy is chosen, Sargobras offers no
options at all. So an owner who never got a name accepted can't name a clan
later. The new "name the clan first" page could become the permanent way: it
doesn't use up a pick, and it could stay available as long as you have no clan.
Want that kept after the test?

## Why didn't we plan with the navmesh?

When the roaming planner was built (Sept 27), it was written as plain C++ with
no server code inside. The aim was to test it offline against the Lua model and
to draw the roaming GIFs without a running server. That meant it needed its own
picture of the ground, and the terrain height map was the one available without
the server. The cost is what you saw: the height map has no walls, rocks or
wreckage, so the planner and the walking disagree about the world. Planning on
the mesh we walk on removes that whole class of bug.

## Can I handle it succinctly?

Yes, if it's built in stages, each one checked in game with the trace before the
next starts:

| Stage | What | Size |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | The mesh decides every spot and route; no straight-line fallback; stuck points skipped | small: one server-side file, a few hundred lines, no new data |
| 2 | Room-and-tunnel graph for long trips, rooms measured on the mesh instead of the height map | medium: reuses the exploring grid |
| 3 | Baked distance maps for towns, docks and area borders | medium: a builder plus saved maps |
| 4 | Chasing with a half-second re-aim, a mesh line check, and smooth turning | small |

Stage 1 alone fixes both of Mozonn's problems.

The pure planner's offline tests and the GIF gallery would keep working on the
drawn maps. The difference is that in game the mesh gets the last word on every
spot.

Under the project rules each stage gets its own issue before code. Shall I write
the four issues and start stage 1?

All four pathfinding stages are written and compile against the real build
flags, and Sargobras has the single naming option you described. None of it has
been built into the server or run. It's ready for your rebuild
(`./scripts/azerothcore update`); nothing is committed yet.

## Sargobras: name first, spoken aloud

The packet log showed that ordinary clicks arrive, but the client never sends
the answer from the name box. That held for the first page and a second page,
with fancy icons and plain ones. So I dropped the box.

- **No clan yet:** Sargobras offers one option, "First, our clan needs a name."
  Choosing it closes the window and he asks you to say the name. Whatever you
  type in /say within 60 seconds becomes the name. Everyone nearby hears it.
- **With a clan:** he shows the class and people options, without any box. A
  refused or taken name never costs you a pick.
- **All buddies chosen but still no clan:** he still offers the naming option.
- **The Acherus soul trade** had the same box on its trade options, so a death
  knight without a clan couldn't have traded at all. It now uses the same rule:
  name first, said aloud.

These are Lua changes, so they're live after the restart (or a `.reload ale`).

## Pathfinding, by stage

1. **The mesh decides.** Each picked spot is moved onto the mesh, and a leg is
   only ordered if the mesh has a complete route to it. If not, the buddy
   follows the mesh's own route to the waypoint, or picks a new waypoint. She
   never walks straight through a wall. Any point she has reached counts as
   passed, and a point with no progress for 3 seconds is skipped. This targets
   both of Mozonn's problems.
2. **Rooms on the mesh.** A grid cell only counts as floor where the mesh is,
   and two cells only join if the mesh lets you step between them. The grid's
   "ready" log line now also counts cells with ground but no mesh, and steps
   blocked by walls.
3. **Distance maps.** These are baked per goal over those joins, and used in two
   places:
   - when roaming can't pick a waypoint, the buddy walks a stretch toward the
     area's middle;
   - in towns, walks to errand NPCs and the mailbox follow the town's map. Until
     a town's grid has been measured (the first minute or so of the first
     visit), the walk falls back to the bot module's own walking, and the trace
     says so.
4. **Steering.** Every second, a roaming buddy picks the nearest monster worth
   experience within 60 yards, hostile or neutral. It re-aims every half second
   at the edge of that monster's own aggro radius: straight if the line is
   clear, otherwise along the mesh route. At the edge it turns to face the
   monster over 0.4 seconds and starts the fight the bot module's way. If it
   can't reach a monster within 20 seconds, it ignores that monster for a
   minute.

## Limits to know while testing

- The smooth 0.4-second turn only happens at the edge, before the fight. While
  moving, the server turns a walker instantly toward its direction of travel;
  smoothing that would need curved paths.
- Stage 2 doesn't load mesh tiles the map hasn't loaded yet. If the grid's "no
  mesh" count comes out large, that's why.

## To test, one piece at a time

1. Rebuild, start, log in Constine, run `.buddy trace Mozonn`.
2. **Stage 1:** walls and standing still. Look for trace lines like "waypoint on
   the mesh", "refused by the mesh", "skipped: no progress".
3. **Stage 4:** she should walk to the edge of a Vale Moth's range and attack
   it. Look for trace lines starting "approach:".
4. **Stage 2:** the "exploring grid … ready" line in `Server.log`.
5. **Stage 3:** "distance map for …" lines, in Ammen Vale or the first time
   she runs errands in town.
6. **Sargobras:** on Karson, choose the naming option, then `/say` a name.

The test tools (`gossip-trace.lua` and the jeweler reader marked `-done`) are
still in place. They'll be removed after one commit, per your rule.

okay but why did it work originally, before we added the icons? Could it be that
it's designed to run exactly once, and not on a per-character basis? Although, I
had a human and a tauren with a bot. So maybe once per faction for some reason?

these two steps seem equivalent. "we pick a spot on the navmesh and if we don't
have a route to it, we follow the navmesh's route to the spot" like what

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Assistant Response 19

Short answers: I don't know why the name box worked on Sept 29, and your "once
per faction" idea fits the facts better than I expected. On stage 1, my wording
mashed two different paths together; corrected below. Town maps can be baked
ahead of time. Roaming fails to pick a waypoint in three situations, listed
below.

## Why the name box worked on Sept 29

The database shows the box really did work then:
- Constine's clan was founded at 13:14:51 and Mozonn joined 11 seconds later.
- Growth's clan was founded at 18:08:55 and its buddy joined 9 seconds later.

That "found the clan, then the buddy joins a few seconds after" timing is the
script's own sequence. Nobody typed a GM command.

**Your "once per faction" idea:**

| Character | Side | Name box |
|---|---|---|
| Constine (human) | Alliance | worked, first ever on that side |
| Growth (tauren) | Horde | worked, first ever on that side |
| Karson (human) | Alliance | fails |
| Mesa (night elf) | Alliance | never got a clan either |

So it fits: one success per side, then nothing, all on the same account (account
101).

But I can't find a mechanism:
- The answer never reaches the server, so nothing on the server can be refusing
  it.
- No server code looks at faction before that point.
- The client is the same Wine 10.20 you ran on Sept 29, since the downgrade put
  you back on it.

The one difference I can name: per-account client settings saved in `WTF/` might
differ from Sept 29, but I haven't checked. A clean test needs the old box back
for one try, on a new Horde character on the same account. If it works there,
the "once per side, per account" pattern is real. I can add the box back as a
second, temporary option next to the spoken one.

## Stage 1, corrected

There are two kinds of path:

- **The planner's path:** a curved chain of points our roaming draws to the
  waypoint, bending around things and onto gentle ground. Each tick she walks to
  the point about 8 yards ahead on that chain.
- **The mesh's route:** the server's own shortest route over the navigation
  mesh, straight to the waypoint.

The check is on the next point of the planner's chain. If the mesh has a
complete route to that point, she walks it. If not, the planner's chain is wrong
here (a point on a rock, behind a wall), so she drops the rest of the chain and
takes the mesh's direct route to the final waypoint. Only if the waypoint itself
is unreachable does she pick a new one. So the two steps are "can I reach the
next bend?", then "can I reach the destination at all?".

## Town maps at compile time

Yes, and with stage 2 it gets simpler: floor and joins now come from the mesh
alone, and the mesh is files on disk (`data-files/mmaps/*.mmtile`). A baking
tool doesn't need a running server.

1. **A build-time baker (what you asked for).** A small C++ tool, built with the
   server, reads each town's mesh tiles and the area numbers from the map files.
   For every errand NPC position in the world database, it writes the town's
   grid and its distance maps to files. The server loads them at start, so maps
   are ready from the first visit. It needs a step in the build or install
   scripts, plus re-baking when the world database's NPC positions change. Size:
   roughly 100 towns × about 10 goals × about 30,000 cells × 2 bytes ≈ 60
   MB, before compression.
2. **Bake at server start, in the background.** No new tool and no files that
   can go out of date, and maps are ready about a minute after start. But it
   reads ground through the running server, so it's a weaker version of what you
   asked for.

I'd do option 1. Shall I write it up as part of the distance-maps stage?

## When roaming can't pick a waypoint

The circling roam (the pinwheel) picks waypoints by circling the area's middle.
It fails when:
1. **Every direction is blocked:** standing in a corner, against a building, or
   on a ledge, with no clear spot all the way around.
2. **No line of sight to the middle:** the circling steers relative to the
   middle, so a hill or building in between stops it. Mozonn hit this twice
   today, high on an Ammen Vale hillside.
3. **No path to any candidate it finds.**

Then it tries the exploring grid's rooms, which fail while that grid is still
being measured (the first minute in a new area) or when she's standing off it.
Stage 1 should make cases 1 and 3 rarer, since spots are now judged on the mesh.
Case 2 is the one the distance-to-middle map replaces.

in this case, we should walk to the top of the hill that is nearest to the
middle, to get a better vantage point. We only have to walk to the top ~85% of
the hill though. If the line-of-sight check still doesn't work, then we walk
upward until it does.

also, if there's a doodad in the way, then we should orbit that doodad until we
get a good line-of-sight. If we do a complete circle, then we should prune the
waypoint paths until they reach out of the circle we made, and then route to
that spot instead. A doodad is a vocabulary term from Warcraft 3, idk if they
use the same terminology here.

also, anytime we turn toward a new point or waypoint, we should always have
lerping orientation smoothing. If we are stopped while turning, we shouldn't
start until we're facing the right direction. If we're moving while turning, we
can keep moving until we're pointed the right way.

The name-box test option is back, the build-time baker and your hill and object
design are written into issues, and the smooth-turn rule is built and compiles.
None of it has been run yet. The build-time baker and the climbing and circling
stage aren't coded; the climbing has three questions for you below.

## Name-box test

With no clan, Sargobras now shows two options:
- "First, our clan needs a name." (say it aloud)
- "(test) Type our clan's name in a box." (the old box)

Make a **new Horde character** on the same account, try the box option, and tell
me. The trace log will show whether the typed answer arrived. If it arrives, the
"once per side, per account" pattern is real. The test option comes out together
with the trace script.

## Smooth turning: built

Every new point now gets a smooth 0.4-second turn if it's more than about 10
degrees off her current facing. This covers the next point on a roaming path,
the first aim at a monster, facing the monster at the edge, and setting off on a
town walk from standing.
- **Standing:** she turns in place, a small step about every 50 ms, and only
  sets off once she faces the right way.
- **Moving:** she keeps moving along a short curve whose heading swings round
  over 0.4 seconds of travel. If that curve would leave the navigation mesh (a
  wall beside her), she stops and turns in place instead.
- Re-aims at a moving monster after the first one don't trigger a turn.
  Otherwise she'd stall mid-chase.

All changed files pass the syntax-only compile. It's in your next rebuild.

## Build-time town baker: written up, not built

It's in the distance-maps issue:
- A tool built with the server reads each town's mesh tiles, the area numbers
  from the map files, and the errand NPC positions from the database, and writes
  one file per town.
- The server loads a town's file instead of measuring the town live.
- A file baked from different mesh files than the ones on disk is refused with
  an error, then measured live, so an out-of-date bake is never walked.
- An install step runs it, and says to re-run it after errand NPCs change.

## Climbing and circling: written up, three questions

It's the new stage 5 in the pathfinding issue set. "Doodad" is WoW's word too:
the map files call placed objects doodads, and the large buildings "world map
objects". Before I build it:

1. **"The hill nearest to the middle"**: which hill?
   - the hilltop nearest the **area's middle**;
   - the hill **in the way**, between her and the middle;
   - the high ground nearest **her**.

   On a hillside like Mozonn's, each picks a different hill.
2. **Pruning after a full circle:** I read it as "cut each candidate path where
   it leaves the circle she walked, and route to that point". Is that it?
3. **Orbit distance:** how far from the object's edge should she circle? A fixed
   few yards, or her own width plus a margin?

one of these three randomly

um sure. We don't even need to make a full circle if the intended path crosses
the orbit circle she's making, then great! Just follow the path. She should
orbit in a random direction each time she comes to such a case.

> 3. Orbit distance: how far from the object's edge should she circle? A fixed

depends on the shape of the object. From it's center to it's most distant
component, add 15-30%.

I built climbing and circling with your three answers, and every changed module
file passes a syntax-only compile with the real build flags. None of it has been
built into the server or run yet. It's ready for your rebuild together with
stages 1–4 and the smooth turning.

When roaming can't pick a waypoint, it now checks what blocks her view of the
area's middle:

- **A placed object (a doodad or a building):**
  - She circles it.
  - The circle's radius is the object's size × 1.15 to 1.30, picked at random
    each time. The size is measured on the exploring grid as the patch of
    non-walkable cells around where her view was blocked: from that patch's
    centre to its farthest cell.
  - She goes a random direction each time, a 4-yard step at a time, on the
    navigation mesh, with the smooth turns.
  - If the middle comes into view anywhere on the circle, she stops circling and
    roams on from there.
  - After a whole circle with no view, she takes a mesh route to a spot 3 yards
    outside the circle on the side facing the middle.
  - A patch over 1,500 cells (a cliff or a town wall), or one that runs off the
    grid, isn't circled.
- **The ground (a hill):**
  - One of your three hills at random: the hilltop nearest the middle, the hill
    in the way, or the high ground nearest her.
  - It must be at least 3 yards above her and reachable over the grid.
  - She climbs it by its distance map and looks again once she's climbed 85% of
    the rise. Still blocked, she looks at every step on up, and gives up at the
    top.
- **Nothing blocks the view** (the roaming failed for another reason): she walks
  a stretch toward the middle by the distance map, as before.

A climb or circle that hasn't finished in 60 seconds is given up. Every decision
writes a "view: …" trace line.

One judgement call in how I built your "if the intended path crosses the orbit
circle, just follow the path": I took the middle coming into view as the sign
that her way out crosses the circle there. Roaming only picks waypoints in sight
of the middle, so a view means it can pick again from that spot.

The new code is in `buddies_roam_strategy.cpp`, `buddies_explore.cpp` and
`buddies_navmesh.cpp`. The climbing-and-circling issue
(`617o5-vantage-and-orbiting.md`) now holds your three answers and what was
built. Nothing is committed yet.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### User Request 22

okay recompiling now. What's the command to watch the buddy's waypoints again?
Also, what else is on our todo list?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Assistant Response 22

To watch a buddy, type as GM:

```
.buddy trace Mozonn
.buddy trace off
```

Lines go to `logs-basic/Playerbots.log`, starting `Mozonn TRACE`, mixed in with
her action lines. Tell me when you've watched her and I'll read it.

## Todo list, most useful first

**Waiting on this rebuild (test):**
1. Mozonn's walking: no walking through walls, no standing still forever, smooth
   turns, and walking up to a Vale Moth's range and attacking it.
2. Sargobras: "First, our clan needs a name.", then `/say` the name.
3. The name-box test: a **new Horde character** on your account tries "(test)
   Type our clan's name in a box."
4. A new level-1 buddy should wear the normal starting outfit, not a fishing
   pole.

**Designed, not built yet:**

5. **Buddy spell learning:**
   - in towns, cheapest spells first until the money runs out;
   - quest and pet spells added to what trainers teach;
   - everything up to its level when a buddy is made;
   - hunter buddies get a random pet when made and a new one on each respec.
6. **Build-time town baker:** distance maps ready on a buddy's first visit to a
   town.

**Waiting on you:**

7. **Uldum jewelers:** move them where you want them, tell me, and I'll save the
   spots like Uldaman.
8. **Sargobras's outfit:** go-ahead for the "mirror image" source patch.
9. **Players on your home network:** set the realm's local address to
   `192.168.1.100`, so they can enter the world without router loopback. One
   database line; not done yet.
10. **The roaming issue's stale "nothing runs in game yet" status:** should I
    update it?

**Housekeeping:**

11. **Commit:** nothing from today is committed.
12. **Temporary test tools:** after that commit, remove the clan packet logger,
    the jeweler reader (renamed to `-done`), and the test name-box option.
13. **Tests for today's fixes:** the starting kit's level window, and stage 1's
    pass/skip rules for path points.

Base directory for this skill: /home/ritz/.claude/skills/upstream-patch-system

# Upstream Patch System

A method for owning customisations to code you didn't write, without forking it.

This describes machinery to build. Everything is plain shell, git and one
small LuaJIT helper; working reference versions ship in this skill's
`scripts/` directory (see "The parts that ship with this skill"). Where the
owner of the project has standing instructions that differ from anything here
(where temporary clones live, what language helper scripts are written in,
whether each patch gets its own issue file, how scripts are laid out), their
instructions win; follow them and adapt the machinery to fit.

---

## Principle: machinery, not procedure

A **procedure** is a sequence someone must remember to work through. A
**machine** is components wired so the outcome falls out with no one's memory
in the loop. This system is built as machinery on purpose:

- **Every "remember to…" is a defect.** Convert it into one of four forms: a
  **guard** (a check that makes an operation a no-op when it shouldn't fire), a
  **trap** (cleanup wired to process exit, so it runs even on failure), a
  **generated artifact** (a derived file that can't drift because it is only
  ever recomputed), or a **gate** (a hard stop until a condition or an approval
  is satisfied).
- **The only inputs left to a human are irreducible.** Three: the
  *transformation itself* (the old→new edit and the anchor that locates it),
  the
  *judgment that a patch belongs upstream*, and the *approval of an outward
  action* (opening a PR, deleting a fork). When patches apply, when they revert,
  whether they still match, what the registry says, whether the tree is clean
  —
  all of that is wired.

---

## The problem this solves

You depend on third-party code and need to change it: fix a build error against
your toolchain, add a hook, silence warnings, tune a constant. The two naive
approaches both rot. **Editing in place** gets clobbered on the next pull, or
silently survives and is forgotten. **A hard fork** turns every upstream update
into a merge conflict until "what did we change and why" is unanswerable.

The third path: **the cloned source tree is a disposable build artifact**,
never committed and never the source of truth. The truth is a directory of
small scripts, each knowing how to *apply* one customisation and how to
*reverse* it. What you version is the intent (the scripts and their headers),
not the result; the result is a deterministic function of
`pinned upstream commit + scripts`.

What it buys: upstream updates stop hurting (a patch that no longer matches
fails loudly and names itself); every change is documented where it is made,
and the registry is generated from those headers; the diff is N small named
edits instead of one sprawling fork diff; changes replay onto any compatible
upstream.

---

## A patch is a reversible function over a text tree

```
apply:    pristine_tree    ->  customised_tree
unapply:  customised_tree  ->  pristine_tree     (exact inverse)
```

Two properties, both enforced mechanically:

1. **Idempotent.** Applying twice equals applying once; same for unapply. The
   enforcement is the **witness guard**, and it is the *first line* of every
   apply and every unapply: apply returns immediately if the patch's marker is
   already present; unapply returns immediately if it is absent. Re-running is
   inert by construction, not by care.
2. **Exact inverse.** `unapply(apply(tree)) == tree`, asserted by the verifier
   (below) against a clean tree, never trusted.

---

## The tiers: separated by when they fire and what they touch

```
PRE-BUILD   (source patches)   after clone, before compile   edits the SOURCE tree
POST-BUILD  (install patches)  after install to staging      sets up the INSTALL tree
POST-DEPLOY (config patches)   after promote to live         tunes the LIVE config
```

The split is chronological because each tier needs something the previous phase
creates: PRE-BUILD needs source present and no binary yet; POST-BUILD needs the
binary installed into staging; POST-DEPLOY needs the live directory to exist so
it can write paths and credentials that point at it. A side benefit: runtime
tuning written after the validation gate cannot fail validation, because
validation runs against complete staging configs.

**PRE-BUILD is the load-bearing tier** — the only one that touches code you
don't own, so the only one whose revert must be exact. The others touch your own
artifacts and behave like ordinary idempotent setup. Wire only the tiers your
chronology needs.

Prefixes (`P`/`I`/`C`) are arbitrary; one tier per prefix, numbered in order, so
a glob selects a tier. The load-bearing line of the whole design is `source/`
in `.gitignore`: a surviving modification to upstream code in your history is,
by construction, a bug.

## The standard patch (marker-wrapped, witness-guarded)

`scaffold-patch P <short-name> <path-under-source>` writes this skeleton with
the next free ID, the functions named, and the marker filled in. The author
writes only the old text, the new text and the header's reasons:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# P017-aggro-radius.sh
#
# TARGET:   src/server/game/Creature.cpp :: GetAttackDistance
# SYMPTOM:  aggro radius shrinks for higher-level players
# CHANGE:   symmetric radius around equal level, because <reason>
# ANCHOR:   float retDistance = 20.0f;
# MATCHES:  1
# MARKER:   P017 aggro-radius

# {{{ patch_needs_applying_P017
patch_needs_applying_P017() {
    local FILE="${SRC}/src/server/game/Creature.cpp"
    require_file P017 "${FILE}"
    ! grep -qF ">>> P017 aggro-radius BEGIN" "${FILE}"
}
# }}}

# {{{ patch_P017_aggro_radius
patch_P017_aggro_radius() {
    local FILE="${SRC}/src/server/game/Creature.cpp"
    patch_needs_applying_P017 || return 0          # witness guard, always first
    replace_exactly "${FILE}" 1 3<<'OLD' 4<<'NEW'
    float retDistance = 20.0f;
    retDistance -= static_cast<float>(levelDiff);
OLD
    // >>> P017 aggro-radius BEGIN
    float retDistance = SymmetricAggroRadius(levelDiff);
    // <<< P017 aggro-radius END
NEW
}
# }}}

# {{{ unpatch_P017_aggro_radius
unpatch_P017_aggro_radius() {
    local FILE="${SRC}/src/server/game/Creature.cpp"
    patch_needs_applying_P017 && return 0          # nothing of ours here
    restore_marked_block "${FILE}" "P017 aggro-radius" 3<<'OLD'
    float retDistance = 20.0f;
    retDistance -= static_cast<float>(levelDiff);
OLD
}
# }}}
```

What the shape guarantees:

- **The old and new text are quoted heredocs handed to a literal matcher.**
  `replace_exactly` (a wrapper over `replace-exactly.lua`) compares characters,
  not a pattern, so nothing in upstream code needs escaping — the hand-escaped
  `sed -z` regexes of earlier versions broke on every `.`, `*`, `[` and `&`. It
  also refuses to edit unless the old text occurs exactly the stated number of
  times: zero means upstream changed the code (the patch is stale), more means
  the anchor is ambiguous.
- **The inverse never re-matches the patched content.** `restore_marked_block`
  replaces the lines from `>>> <label> BEGIN` through `<<< <label> END` with the
  original text (or with nothing, for a patch that only inserted lines).
  Upstream
  reflowing around the block can't break it, and a sibling patch can't hit it.
- **The marker is the witness.** The probe, the guard and the inverse all key
  on the same string, so they agree by construction. The markers use
  `>>> … BEGIN` / `<<< … END` rather than editor fold markers, so they don't
  fold up or mis-nest inside the upstream code they sit in.
- **A pure insertion** puts the anchor line into both OLD and NEW (NEW is the
  anchor plus the marked block), and its unapply restores an empty block.
- **A patch that edits two places** uses two labels (`P026 engine-guard`,
  `P026 login-fix`), each with its own guard, and a probe that reports "needed"
  if either marker is missing.
- **Missing target files are an error**, not a skip: `require_file` stops the
  run and calls the patch stale. A patch whose target legitimately doesn't exist
  in some profile says so in its probe instead —
  `[[ -f "${FILE}" ]] || { echo " [P017] skipped: target absent (optional in
  this profile)"; return 1; }`
  — so the skip is declared and announced, never silent.
- **Single-line edits may use a `sed` line address** (`sed -i '/anchor/a\ …'`,
  `/anchor/i\`, `/anchor/c\`) inside the same guard and markers, the way many of
  the reference project's patches do. The guard and the marker-range inverse are
  what matter; the literal matcher is for multi-line text.

**Detecting convergence.** Because upstream never ships your marker, the
witness can't tell you when upstream adopted your change. A patch can define an
optional `converged_P017` function that checks for the new behaviour *without*
markers (for example, `grep -qF "SymmetricAggroRadius" "${FILE}"`); the audit
uses it to tell RETIRE from STALE.

---

## The build driver

The project's `scripts/compile` wires the pieces so each step guarantees what
the next relies on:

```bash
set -euo pipefail                            # a failed step stops the run
source "${DIR}/patches/patches.sh"           # settings, patches, patches-lib.sh

# Normal builds use the pin. "--from-checkout" builds whatever each repository
# has checked out and records it as the new pin on success: the first build of
# a project, and the build inside update-upstream. No lock and no flag is an
# error, never a quiet switch to the checkout.
FROM_CHECKOUT=no
[[ "${1:-}" == "--from-checkout" ]] && FROM_CHECKOUT=yes
if [[ "${FROM_CHECKOUT}" == yes ]]; then
    reset_source_trees current
else
    [[ -f "${LOCK_FILE}" ]] || die "no ${LOCK_FILE} yet; run compile --from-checkout for the first build"
    reset_source_trees pinned                # source == the recorded commits
fi
trap 'unapply_applied; reset_source_trees current' EXIT   # armed BEFORE applying
apply_tier PREBUILD_PATCHES                  # a failure part-way is still undone
build
install_to_staging
apply_tier POSTBUILD_PATCHES
trap - EXIT
unapply_applied                              # success path: explicit revert
[[ "${FROM_CHECKOUT}" == yes ]] && write_lock   # the pin moves only on success
```

- **`set -euo pipefail` at the top.** Without it a failed compile carries on
  into install and revert, and the pin advances past a build that never
  succeeded.
- **The trap is armed before the first patch is applied.** If patch 7 of 12
  fails, patches 1–6 are taken back off; arming after the apply step would
  leave them on the tree until the next reset.
- **The reset runs first, every time.** It covers the one failure a trap
  cannot: a kill that ends the shell outright (SIGKILL, out of memory, power
  loss). It also runs `git clean -fd`, so files a patch created are removed.
- **`unapply_applied` only reverts what this run applied**, newest first, and
  reports each revert only when the tree actually changed. "Nothing printed" is
  measured, not guessed.

`redownload-source` (delete `source/` and clone again) is the regeneration
lever, safe precisely because all the real work lives in `patches/`.

---

## The pin and the upstream update

`.upstream-lock` is a **pin**, not a note: one line per repository
(`. <commit>` for the main tree, `<path> <commit>` for each nested repository
under `SUBREPO_GLOB`). Every normal build resets to exactly those commits, so
builds are reproducible and "it built yesterday" stays true. Moving the pin is
its own command, `scripts/update-upstream`:

```bash
set -euo pipefail
source "${DIR}/patches/patches.sh"
cp "${LOCK_FILE}" "${DIR}/.upstream-lock.previous"
while IFS= read -r repository; do                       # fetch every repository
    git -C "${repository}" fetch --quiet origin HEAD
    git -C "${repository}" checkout --quiet --detach FETCH_HEAD
done < <(source_repositories)
reset_source_trees current
audit_patches PREBUILD_PATCHES "${DIR}/.upstream-lock.previous"   # may stop here
"${DIR}/scripts/compile" --from-checkout                 # builds, then writes the pin
```

(`verify-patches` resets to the pin while one exists, so run it after the
update's build has moved the pin, or wire it into the build itself.)

The pin moves only at the very end of a successful build; a failure leaves the
previous pin in place, so the next audit always
compares against a version that actually built. A repository that appears
under `SUBREPO_GLOB` but isn't in the lock stops a pinned build with a message
to run the update.

---

## The audit: are these patches still needed?

`audit_patches <tier> <previous-lock>` judges each patch against the pristine
new tree and writes `docs/patches/audit-<commit>.md`, one row per patch:

| Verdict | Meaning |
|---|---|
| OK | anchor present the declared number of times, and upstream didn't touch lines near it |
| REVIEW | upstream changed lines within a few lines of the anchor; the patch may still apply, but what it means there may have changed |
| RETIRE | the anchor is gone and `converged_<ID>` finds upstream now ships the change |
| STALE | the target file is gone, the anchor is gone, or it occurs the wrong number of times |

The changed ranges come from `git diff --unified=0 <old> <new>` hunk headers.
When the source is a shallow clone that lacks the old commit, the audit fetches
it (`git fetch --depth=1 origin <old>`) before diffing, because a diff needs
both ends.

**The report is the worklist.** It is written to a tracked docs directory, one
line per decision, so it survives the next reset (the earlier design inserted
comment tags into the source tree, which dirtied the tree during the build,
shifted the line numbers other patches were anchored to, and was erased by the
next reset before anyone read it). `AUDIT_BLOCKS=yes` makes any non-OK verdict
stop the update; `no` reports and continues — typically `yes` for releases and
`no` while iterating locally.

---

## The generator, the verifier and the registry

- **`scaffold-patch <tier-prefix> <short-name> <path>`** — next free ID, the
  skeleton above, the comment token chosen from the file's extension (an
  unknown extension stops rather than guesses).
- **`verify-patches`** — the gate, wired into the build or CI. For each patch
  in
  the profile, from a clean tree: the probe says "needed"; the `ANCHOR` line
  occurs `MATCHES` times; applying flips the probe; applying again changes
  nothing; unapplying returns the tree to the exact commit; unapplying again
  changes nothing. Then the whole profile is applied together and removed, to
  catch two patches that step on each other. A probe that can only ever say
  "needed" (because it looks in the wrong file) fails the second check, which is
  exactly how a patch silently stops applying in real projects.
- **`gen-registry`** — rebuilds `docs/patches/patch-registry.md` from the
  `TARGET`, `SYMPTOM` and `CHANGE` header fields. Never edited by hand, so it
  can't drift.

---

## The orchestrator (`patches/patches.sh`)

The project file sets the settings `patches-lib.sh` requires (it names them in
its header and refuses to start if any is missing), declares the per-profile
lists, sources every patch file by glob, then sources the library:

```bash
DIR="/path/to/project"
SRC="${DIR}/source"
SUBREPO_GLOB="modules/*"           # nested repositories, or "" for none
LOCK_FILE="${DIR}/.upstream-lock"
AUDIT_DIR="${DIR}/docs/patches"
AUDIT_BLOCKS="yes"
PATCH_HELPER="${DIR}/scripts/replace-exactly.lua"
PATCHES_DIR="${DIR}/patches"
PROFILE="$(cat "${DIR}/.profile")"   # a missing .profile is an error, not "standard"

declare -A PREBUILD_PATCHES=(
    ["minimal"]="P001 P004"
    ["standard"]="P001 P004 P009 P024"
    ["full"]="P001 P002 P003 P004 P009 P024"
)
declare -A POSTBUILD_PATCHES=( ["minimal"]="" ["standard"]="I001" ["full"]="I001 I002" )

for patch_file in "${PATCHES_DIR}"/[PIC][0-9][0-9][0-9]-*.sh; do source "${patch_file}"; done
source "${DIR}/scripts/patches-lib.sh"
```

Adding a file registers it; there is no manifest to keep in sync. Dispatch is by
naming convention, and every lookup demands exactly one match: a profile ID with
no matching function, a patch with no probe, or a profile missing from a tier
array stops the run with the name of what's missing. (A typo in a profile list
used to disable that patch without a word.)

**Profiles** are named selections of patches from the one `patches/` directory.
The "a/b variant" pattern encodes "same setting, different value per profile" as
two sibling patches with non-overlapping profile lists, so exactly one fires and
the old value stays visible as its own file.

---

## De-patching: three mechanisms, each wired to its own trigger

| Mechanism | Wired to | Guarantee |
|---|---|---|
| `unapply_applied` | the EXIT trap and the success path | reverses exactly what this run applied |
| `reset_source_trees` | every build entry and every defensive position | sends each repository to a commit; cannot invent changes |
| `apply-patches --revert` | the operator's control panel | revert by hand; for source patches, triggers an incremental rebuild |

Why defensive cleanup is always a reset and never an unapply: an unapply that
recognises its target by the *patched content* can't tell "we applied this"
from "upstream now ships this", and run defensively on a tree where upstream
converged it reverts clean code into false dirt. Marker-based inverses are
immune (upstream never ships your marker, so there's nothing to match), which is
one more reason markers are the standard. But a reset is simpler still and
correct for every patch style, so it owns every defensive position.

---

## The parts that ship with this skill

`scripts/` in this skill holds working, tested reference versions. Copy them
into
the project's `scripts/`, set `DIR` at the top of each (they refuse to run while
it still reads `__PROJECT_ROOT__`), and adapt:

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `replace-exactly.lua` | literal replace with an exact count; `count`, `lines` and `restore` modes |
| `patches-lib.sh` | apply/unapply drivers with probe checks, content-aware revert reporting, pinned reset, lock writing, audit |
| `scaffold-patch` | patch file generator |
| `verify-patches` | the per-patch and whole-profile gate |
| `gen-registry` | registry generator |

The build driver and `update-upstream` are project-specific (what "build" and
"install" mean differs every time), so they appear above as wiring, not files.

For the contribution driver (turning a patch into an upstream pull request) see
`contributing.md`; for non-textual patches, prose patch docs, and the full list
of failures the machine forecloses, see `reference.md`. Both are in this
skill's directory.

---

## Assembling the machine in a new project

- `source/` (or `vendor/`, or the submodule path) in `.gitignore`; commit only
  `patches/`, `scripts/` and `docs/patches/`.
- Copy the shipped scripts, write `patches/patches.sh`.
- Write the build driver with the wiring above; write `update-upstream`.
- First build: `compile --from-checkout` builds whatever is checked out and
  writes the pin at the end; after that, plain `compile` builds the pin.
- Add patches with `scaffold-patch`; nothing enters a profile until
  `verify-patches` passes it.
- Add POST-BUILD or POST-DEPLOY tiers only when the chronology needs them.

---

## Open questions to settle with the owner

- Does each patch need its own issue file, or is the patch header (target,
  symptom, change) its blueprint? The owner's standing instructions decide; if
  they don't say, ask.

All four items are done. Everything new compiles against the real build flags,
but none of it has run in game yet. The rebuild you started earlier began before
these changes, so they need one more rebuild.

**Buddy spell learning**
- In towns, a buddy buys the cheapest lesson it can learn, then looks again,
  since learning one rank can unlock the next. It stops at the first lesson it
  can't afford, with only a debug log line. Then it learns its class's quest
  spells for free.
- A new buddy learns every trainer lesson and quest spell up to its level when
  it's made, free.
- A hunter buddy of level 10 or more gets a random tameable beast when it first
  logs in without a pet, and a new one every time its talents reset (your respec
  resets them).
- The quest-spell list comes from a new generator,
  `scripts/generate-buddy-quest-spells`. It found 48 class quests that reward a
  spell. A buddy only learns a spell from that list if the game's own skill
  tables give it to that class and race, which filters out old pre-3.0 priest
  spells and a quest's bomb.

**Sargobras's outfit**
- New source patch `B047`, for the basic profile only. It gives the server a
  list of "this creature wears this look". When the client asks what a
  mirror-image creature looks like, a listed creature is answered with its
  listed look.
- Applying it twice and reverting it twice on a copy of the server file left
  that file exactly as it was.
- The buddy module lists the look for all three Sargobras (the valley one, the
  wanderer, and Acherus), and gives them a human male body and the mirror-image
  flag.
- The hair style ("Bald") and beard ("Bearded") numbers are my guesses. To tune
  them live, use `.buddy look hair <n>` or `.buddy look beard <n>`, walk out of
  sight and back to see the change, then tell me the right numbers.

**Town baker**
- A tool at `tools/buddy-town-baker/` reads the map, mesh and area files and
  writes one file per town into `data-files/buddy-towns/`.
- The server reads a town's file instead of spending about a minute measuring
  it, after checking that the layout matches and that every mesh file is still
  the same size and age. On a mismatch it logs why and measures live.
- The server and the baker now share code for the grid layout and slope rule,
  the mesh questions, which areas are towns, and the file format, so the two
  can't drift apart.
- That sharing caught a real disagreement: the baker had counted starting
  valleys like Ammen Vale as towns, which the server deliberately doesn't.
  Fixed.
- I ran it on a scratch copy of your data folder: 150 town pieces in 8 seconds,
  15 MB. Three Northrend pieces have no mesh under them, so they get no file and
  the server measures them live.
- **To run it for real:** `scripts/bake-buddy-towns`. It compiles the baker
  first, which you said you want to watch. Install step `E049` also runs it, but
  skips with a message on a fresh install until the area table exists, after the
  server's first start.
- One accepted difference from live measuring: the baker reads ground height and
  area numbers from the terrain only, while the live measuring also counts
  buildings. Town streets are terrain, so I expect this to rarely matter.

**Roaming issue status:** updated. It now says roaming runs in game, what went
wrong today, and that stage 1 of the pathfinding work answers it.

**Still waiting on you:**
- Run the one database line for local network players? It would set the realm's
  local address to `192.168.1.100`.
- After the rebuild, test as before, plus a new buddy's spells, a hunter buddy's
  pet, Sargobras's new look, and the Horde name-box test.

Nothing is committed yet.

### User Request 25

do you think it'd be better to transition to using the playerbots pathfinding
and bot behaviors? They're battletested. Also, we can tell them when to switch
between certain profiles, and what areas to "grind" in and such, right? I dunno,
having second thoughts. Lemme test it again.

> - Run the one database line for local network players? It would set the
> realm's local address to

you didn't answer me about the remote and local players at once. If they both
can play then yes.

okay the map generator did map 0, 1, 530, and 571. Is that intended? What about
the numbers between those?

Sargobras's clothes look right, but the face and hair and beard are wrong.
Here's what he looks like:

[Image #18] 

here's what he's supposed to look like:

[Image #19] 

typing the guild name as a chat message for Karson worked!

Picking a buddy bot for Karson worked, after the guild name was picked!

I noticed the buddy-bot when first spawned is just standing around? We should
update their behavior. Maybe if the player moves beyond 10 yards, they start to
follow until they're at 10 yards from the player? And once the player is ~30
yards from the initial spawn point, they'll start exploring and adventuring. Or
maybe we should just have them wave / salute / bow / flex / nod? I added a
couple. Then once they've done that, wait a couple seconds 3-4, then turn lerp
style in a direction and go off to adventure. I think that'll be a bit cleaner.

what else should I test now?

Sargobras's head and the new buddy entrance are fixed in code; both need another
rebuild. The realm change is live. On the bot module: try today's build first,
and if roaming still misbehaves, switching to the bot module's own roaming is a
reasonable fallback, not a rewrite.

## Remote and local players at once

Yes, both can play at the same time. I've made the change. The login server
picks an address per player:

| Player connects from | Gets sent to |
|---|---|
| This machine | `192.168.1.100` |
| Your home network (192.168.1.x) | `192.168.1.100`, direct, no router loopback needed |
| Anywhere else | `wow.ritzmenardi.com` (your public IP, through the router's port forwarding) |

## Switching to the bot module's own pathfinding and roaming?

Yes, it's possible, and you can control it. A bot's behaviour is a set of
strategies that can be switched on and off per bot at any time. Your config
already has the relevant knobs: `GrindDistance` 75, `RpgDistance` 200, and
weights for "wander", "go grind", "do quest" and so on.

What it would and wouldn't fix:
- **Walls are not fixed by switching.** The bot module walks through the same
  server movement, with the same straight-line fallback when the mesh finds no
  route. Stage 1 of today's build blocks that fallback for our roaming. The bot
  module's roaming would still hit it.
- **Its grinding picks a hunting spot for its level across the zone** and goes
  there, so buddies would drift away from you. We'd add a leash that keeps them
  in your area.
- **What's ours either way:** following you between areas, town visits, boat
  crossings and the entrance.

My suggestion: test today's build first. Stage 1 fixes Mozonn's two bugs
directly, and the monster approach gives her fights in Ammen Vale. If roaming
still misbehaves, swap our roaming for their grind-and-wander strategies plus an
area leash. That would be a small change in one place, not a rewrite.

## Maps 0, 1, 530, 571

That's intended. Those are the four open-world continents: Eastern Kingdoms,
Kalimdor, Outland and Northrend. The numbers in between are dungeons, raids,
battlegrounds and Acherus, each its own map. The area table does cover them, but
none has an area the client flags as a town, so nothing there gets baked.
Buddies don't roam inside dungeons anyway.

## Sargobras's head

The client's own tables answered it:
- **Hair:** for a human male, hair style **0** is the only one marked bald
  ("shows scalp"). My guess of 11 was a long style, hence the blond mane.
- **Beard:** style **4** is the only one with all three parts (moustache, chin
  and sideburns), matching your picture.
- **Skin, face and hair colour:** your customizer seems to count from 1 and the
  client from 0, so they're now 6, 7 and 0. I'm not sure of this one. If he's
  still off, use `.buddy look skin <n>` (or `face` or `haircolor`) and walk out
  of sight and back.

## New buddy entrance

The standing around was the old design waiting for you to walk 10 yards off. Now
the buddy steps forward and turns to you as before, then:
1. does one of wave, salute, bow, flex or nod at random (recorded for its
   personality later);
2. pauses 3 to 4 seconds;
3. turns smoothly to a random heading;
4. goes off roaming.

It compiles; it needs the rebuild.

## What to test now

**Already in your current build:**
1. Mozonn with `.buddy trace Mozonn`:
   - no walking through walls;
   - no standing still forever;
   - smooth turns;
   - walking up to a Vale Moth's range and attacking it.

   Tell me when you've watched her and I'll read the trace.
2. A new **level-10+ buddy** (from a wandering Sargobras): it should know its
   spells, and a hunter should arrive with a pet.
3. A town errand: a buddy at a class trainer buys the cheapest spells first. The
   first time in a town it walks the old way while the town is measured, unless
   you've run the bake.
4. The **Horde name-box test**, if you still want it. The spoken naming works,
   so the test option could just be removed instead.

**After the next rebuild:**

5. Sargobras's face.
6. A new buddy's entrance.

To bake towns before testing town walks, run `scripts/bake-buddy-towns`. It
compiles the baker first, so you'll see that output.

### User Request 27

The buddybot for Karson is named Carago, and he's currently stuck between two
behaviors. Also, the starting zones I noticed treat the entire valley as one
area, but there's a clear "town" and "wilderness" area in each. Do you have any
suggestions for how to get them to do "town" behaviors when the player is in
town, and "adventuring" when the player is doing so? Also Carago didn't seem to
walk into the structure in Ammen Vale.

I think we should stick with our homebrew pathfinding, and just hack on it until
it works.

Carago was stuck between two behaviours, and I've fixed that in code; it needs
your rebuild.

## What Carago was doing

The trace shows a loop:
1. He reached the edge of a neutral Volatile Mutation's range (about 20 yards)
   and started the fight.
2. The bot module saw no fight yet (a neutral monster that hasn't been hit isn't
   one), so it dropped the target.
3. My approach code picked the same monster again, turned 106° toward it, and
   started over.

Roaming got a few ticks in between, which is the other behaviour you saw.

The fix:
- **Melee buddies now run in after the monster** and swing, so the first blow
  lands and the fight becomes real. Ranged buddies still start from the edge
  with their class's pull.
- **If no fight has begun 5 seconds after starting one, that monster is skipped
  for a minute.** The trace records what the bot module would have objected to
  (line of sight, can it detect the monster, friendliness), so if this happens
  again we'll see why.

## Town versus wilderness in the starting valleys

The data backs you up. Ammen Vale is a single area, but its shops and trainers
all stand in one camp, roughly 110 by 50 yards around (−4120, −13750), about
100 yards south of what the game considers the area's middle. My suggestions,
most likely to work first:

1. **Find the town from the people in it.** Take the area's real service NPCs
   (trainers, vendors, repairers, innkeepers, flight masters), ignoring the
   hidden placeholder NPCs that share those flags. Draw a circle around them,
   plus a margin of about 15 yards. Inside it, your buddies do the town visit;
   outside it, they adventure.
   - Add a 10-yard gap between switching in and switching out, so they don't
     flicker when you stand at the edge.
   - The baker could compute these circles along with the town grids.
   - It also works for camps and quest hubs anywhere in the world that the game
     doesn't flag as towns.
2. **Use the game's own subzones where they exist.** Northshire Abbey, for
   example, has its own area number. But Ammen Vale's camp has none, so this
   alone isn't enough.
3. **Hand-placed town circles:** a GM command like `.buddy town here <radius>`,
   the same way beds are placed, used to override 1 where its circle comes out
   wrong.

I'd build 1, with 3 available as an override. Shall I?

## Agreed: stay homebrew

We keep our pathfinding and fix it as we go.

## One question

"Carago didn't seem to walk into the structure in Ammen Vale." Do you mean he no
longer walked *through* its walls (good: that's stage 1 working), or that he
never went *inside* it when he should have?

## Testing now

- Felicity's new level-10+ buddy: spells, and a pet if it's a hunter.
- Towns are baked, so a buddy's first town errand should walk by the map
  straight away. The server log should show "read from its bake".
- After the next rebuild: Carago fighting Volatile Mutations properly,
  Sargobras's face, and a new buddy's entrance.

if you can spawn a whisp NPC that stands at the radius chosen, at every point of
the circle, and disappears after 15 seconds. When I say "a wisp" what I mean is
however many wisps it'd take to fully define the circle.

I found 163 town circles across the four continents and built the town-circle
code, but I haven't run it in game yet. The circles reach the database through
your next rebuild and install (new install step E050).

## The circles found

I grouped every cluster of at least 3 helpful NPCs standing within 35 yards of
each other. That covers trainers, vendors, repairers, flight masters,
innkeepers, bankers and auctioneers, leaving out the hidden placeholder NPCs.
Circles that overlapped or nearly touched were merged into one town. Some of the
163:

| Kind | Examples |
|---|---|
| Starting camps | Crash Site (Ammen Vale's camp; the game names that spot as its own sub-area), Northshire, Deathknell, Coldridge, Valley of Trials, Camp Narache, Sunstrider Isle, Aldrassil |
| Towns and camps | Brill, **The Bulwark**, Goldshire, Razor Hill, Sentinel Hill, Booty Bay, Azure Watch, Area 52, Zim'Torga |
| Cities | Stormwind, Orgrimmar, Ironforge (its circle is named after Dun Morogh, the zone around it), Thunder Bluff, Shattrath, Dalaran. These are already towns in the game's area table, so nothing changes there. |

A few 3-person stragglers sit beside a bigger circle (one each at Coldridge,
Aldrassil and the Valley of Trials). Your hand-placed circles can replace those.
To see the full list, run `scripts/generate-buddy-town-circles`.

## How it behaves

- Inside a circle, your buddies run the town visit. Outside, they adventure.
- You stay "in town" until you're 10 yards outside the circle, so standing on
  the edge doesn't make them switch back and forth.
- Flagged towns work as before.

## Placing circles by hand

As GM:
- `.buddy town here <radius>` places a circle centred on you.
- `.buddy town show` draws the nearest circle.
- `.buddy town remove` removes the nearest hand-placed circle.

Each command draws the circle in wisps: one every 3 yards around the edge (at
most 240), friendly and untouchable, gone after 15 seconds. Hand-placed circles
go into the database immediately. Run `scripts/generate-buddy-town-circles`
afterwards to save them into the project too, so a reinstall keeps them.

## Also in the next rebuild

- **Carago's stuck loop is fixed:** melee buddies now charge in, and a fight
  that hasn't started after 5 seconds skips that monster.
- Sargobras's face.
- The new buddy entrance.

## Carago and the structure

That's noted as an open question in the stage-1 navmesh issue
(`617o1-mesh-decides.md`), to settle once we've tested more.

okay hold those thoughts, I am curious but I'm doing a live test right now so I
wanna focus on what's in front of me. My girlfriend logged in, picked a buddy
bot, did a little bit of adventuring, then logged out. She did so by "exiting
game", not by "logging out". Then, she restarted the game, and now when she logs
in her buddy-bot is still in a party with her, but he's disconnected and doesn't
seem to want to log in. Can you make some kind of timer, after any player logs
in, that logs in one buddy bot per 1-3 seconds until they're all logged in? Just
for that character's buddy-bots of course.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Assistant Response 29

I've built the timer, but your girlfriend needs a workaround now, because the
timer only takes effect after a rebuild.

**Getting her buddy back now:** have her log out the normal way, wait about 10
seconds, then log back in. I expect the server's one-time "log in her buddies"
request at login to bring Olinigo back; I haven't tested it.

**What went wrong:** Aurelia's buddy is Olinigo. When she used "Exit Game" and
came straight back, her old session was still being closed. Her new login asked
for Olinigo once, but he still counted as online, so the request did nothing.
Then the old session finished closing and logged him out at 18:54:14. Nothing
ever asked again, so he stayed in her group, shown as disconnected.

**The timer** (in `buddies_login.cpp`, syntax-checked, not built):
- Whenever someone is logged in, the server checks their buddies. Each 1 to 3
  seconds it logs in one missing buddy, until all are in.
- After that it checks again every 5 seconds, so a buddy that drops later comes
  back on its own, including the one in this "Exit Game" case.
- It's safe to repeat: the bot module ignores a request for a buddy that's
  already loading or online.
- Each time it brings one in, the server log says so: "…'s buddy … is not
  online; logging it in".

I've noted this in the buddy-login issue.

### User Request 30

okay now Marvaria (Maroon's buddy-bot) has a full inventory, and she keeps
spamming her owner about it instead of going home to sell. I think we should
build that behavior into them - they should move to the nearest town / vendor
and sell what they need to.

I've added the selling trip and a fix that stops the "My bags are full"
whispers. Both compile against the real build flags, but neither has been built
into the server or run, so Marvaria will keep whispering until your next
rebuild.

**Why it happened:** a buddy only sold things during a town visit, and town
visits only happen when you're in a town. Out in the wild, every failed pickup
made the bot module whisper "My bags are full" to her owner.

**What a buddy now does when her bags are 90% full** (the same "full" line the
town visit uses):
1. She stops picking new fights and heads for the nearest vendor on the map.
   There are 2,056 vendors in the world database, not counting hidden
   placeholder NPCs.
2. She walks there in stretches of up to 80 yards. She only takes a stretch if
   the navigation mesh has a full route for it, and tries a 30-yard stretch if
   the long one has none, so she doesn't walk through walls.
3. At the vendor she sells exactly what the town visit sells, silently:
   - junk;
   - whatever the auction rules decided should go to a vendor;
   - extra items, cleared in rounds until her bags are below 90% full;
   - then she restocks her food.
4. She goes back to roaming. If that left her in a different area from you, her
   normal travel brings her back.
5. If she doesn't reach the vendor within 3 minutes, she gives up and that
   vendor is skipped for 10 minutes. The same happens if the vendor isn't there
   when she arrives, or there's no route.

**The whispers:** a new source patch, `B048`, stops the bot module whispering
about failed item moves for buddies only; other bots still do. I applied and
reverted it on a copy of the file, and the file came back exactly as it was.

To watch it after the rebuild, run `.buddy trace Marvaria`. Lines starting
`sell:` show her bag percentage, the vendor she picked, and the sale.

This is written up as a new issue (`617h1-selling-trip.md`). Nothing is
committed yet.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### User Request 31

can we make an issue file for a new loot system for the buddy-bots? They should
set the loot rules to "free for all" or maybe "group loot but buddy bots pass on
everything" if that's possible. Then, they should loot corpses to try and
maintain a proper ratio so that everyone has looted roughly the same amount of
times.

Also... when buddy-bots are in dangerous areas, like the monsters are tougher
than they expect, they should stick closer to the player.

Alright Marvaria is stuck on a transition between two areas - Ammen Vale and the
rest of Azuremyst isle. I traced her, can you look into what's going on?

oh as soon as I came close she seems to have unstuck herself...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Assistant Response 31

> Reading Marvaria's trace first.

Both issue files are written: `617j1-loot-turns.md` and
`617e10-closer-in-danger.md`. Each has questions for you before anything is
built. Marvaria's trace is explained above, and the "pacing" fix is waiting for
your yes.

## Loot turns (`617j1-loot-turns.md`)

What's in it:
- When a group has buddies in it, the leader sets the loot rule to either **free
  for all** or **group loot with buddies always passing**. Both are possible
  with the game's own rules.
- Each group member's count of corpses looted is kept. A corpse goes to whoever
  has the lowest count, nearest first on a tie. The others leave it alone, so
  over time everyone loots about the same number of times.
- The counts reset when the group changes (buddies join and leave by distance).

Questions for you:
1. **Free for all, or group loot with buddies passing?** With free for all,
   whoever has the turn takes everything on that corpse. With group loot, the
   good items (green and up) are rolled for, the buddies always pass, so every
   good drop goes to you; the turns only share out the ordinary loot.
2. **Are you part of the count**, or do only the buddies take turns among
   themselves while you loot whatever you like?
3. **How long should a buddy wait for you** to take your turn before the corpse
   passes to the next lowest count?

## Closer in danger (`617e10-closer-in-danger.md`)

What's in it:
- Each buddy keeps a danger reading. It goes up quickly from tougher or
  higher-level monsters nearby, elites, packs, and fights that went badly. It
  comes down slowly.
- The higher the reading, the tighter the leash: the buddy only roams within a
  shrinking circle around you, and the monster approach skips monsters that are
  too strong for it.
- As things calm down, the leash lets out again.

Questions for you:
1. **What counts as "tougher than they expect"?** Monster levels compared with
   the buddy's, elites, packs, how its fights actually went, or a mix of these?
2. **How close is "closer"?** A fixed leash whenever it's dangerous (say 30
   yards), or one that tightens step by step as danger grows?
3. **Whose danger is it?** Each buddy's own, or shared by the whole clan, so
   that one buddy's bad fight pulls all of them in?

alright I wanna test Zul Farrak with my character Feldowinn. Can you teleport me

we handled it for Felicity? My buddybot Mathis will need gear and abilities too.

Feldowinn and Matis are both level 46 at Zul'Farrak's entrance. Abilities are
handled the same way as for Felicity. Matis still has no new gear, and Sargobras
probably isn't there yet.

## Done

- **Teleport:** both are at the entrance.
- **Feldowinn's abilities:**
  - He now knows Redemption and Summon Thalassian Warhorse, the paladin spells
    that come from quests.
  - 75 gold is in his mailbox. The Silvermoon paladin lessons up to 46 cost
    about 70 gold, more than Felicity's 50.
  - To get a trainer next to you, as GM: `.npc add temp 16680` (Ithelis, a
    Silvermoon paladin trainer). `temp` means he's gone after a restart.
- **Matis's abilities:** a buddy can't train himself at a trainer you spawn, so
  I taught him directly. He has all 76 Silvermoon paladin lessons up to 46 (he
  already knew Devotion Aura), plus Redemption and the warhorse.
- **Feldowinn's gear:** his mailbox has the white "Platemail" set (required
  level 45): helm, chest, belt, legs, boots, bracers and gloves. That's the
  buddy kit's rule: the best white vendor item from levels 42–46. Nothing
  white fits shoulders, cloak or a two-handed weapon in that range.

For Felicity I only handled abilities, not gear. Her gear would be a new step,
if you want it.

## Not done

- **Matis's gear:** the server console can't put items on another character, and
  buddies ignore trade and chat commands by design. The clean fix is a GM
  command, `.buddy kit Matis`, that re-runs the starting kit for his current
  level. It needs a rebuild. Shall I add it?
- **Sargobras:** reaching level 46 should have summoned his wandering Sargobras,
  but the teleport right afterwards probably sent him away. He follows only on
  the same map. Log Feldowinn out and back in, and the login brings Sargobras to
  you. Or, as GM: `.npc add temp 6170001` (the valley Sargobras, who serves
  anyone owed a buddy).

## Before the live test, we were on

- **Town circles:** built, not yet run. 163 circles found, including the Bulwark
  and Ammen Vale's camp. `.buddy town here <radius>`, `.buddy town show` and
  `.buddy town remove` draw a circle in wisps for 15 seconds.
- **Carago's fight loop:** fixed (melee buddies charge in; a fight that hasn't
  started after 5 seconds skips that monster).
- **The "walk into the structure" question:** parked for more testing.

## During the live test

- The buddy login watcher (one buddy every 1–3 seconds) was built.
- The selling trip and the end of the "My bags are full" whispers were built.
- The loot-turns and closer-in-danger issues were written. **Six questions are
  waiting on you** there:

  **Loot turns:**
  1. Free for all, or group loot with buddies passing?
  2. Are you part of the corpse count?
  3. How long should a buddy wait for your turn?

  **Closer in danger:**
  4. What counts as "tougher"?
  5. A fixed leash, or one that tightens step by step?
  6. Each buddy's own danger, or shared by the clan?
- **Marvaria pacing:** the fix (after 5 hops within 20 yards, take a stretch
  toward the area's middle) is waiting for your yes.

Everything from today needs one rebuild and is uncommitted.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### User Request 33

> For Felicity I only handled abilities, not gear. Her gear would be a new step,
> if you want it.

ah yeah that was done previously. Can you give Feldowinn and Mathis some gear?
They can have the same gear set. Can you tell me what happens if we level a
character DOWN while they still have buddy-bots? Can we store them, and ensure
that only the correct ones spawn, and when Sargobras shows up, he says "Oh it
looks like you already have a buddy-bot for this stage of your journey. Here let
me summon them..." and then re-enables them?

The level 40 paladins were created with mail gear for some reason. Also a cloth
hat. Can we make sure they have cloaks as well? Also, none of them have weapons.
They should have weapons appropriate to the talent set they were assigned at
their creation. Also they seem to only be going far enough in their main talent
tree to have 25 points before branching off - I thought we were going to 31
before we started putting in the alternate talent tree? Although, the one who's
100% Ret (Zearea) went 37 points in Ret, and went all the way down to the 31st
talent... Can we spawn buddy-bots who have gear that has sockets (most white
gear if I remember correctly after our patches) Can we have them spawn with gems
that match their talent set? We should have different stat priorities for each
talent profile they can spawn with. Make sure their gear is socketed correctly,
but more importantly make sure that they'll socket their own gear when they get
the chance.

Also, I entered the dungeon, and they're all just standing at the entrance.
What's up with that? Aren't they supposed to clear the dungeon, Playerbots
style? How does Playerbots handle dungeons and raids and such?

> - Matis's abilities: a buddy can't train himself at a trainer you spawn, so I
> taught him directly. He has all

Hmmm we should probably make an issue file about this. The intended behavior is
that they will notice friendly NPCs within 100 yards and identify what
capabilities that NPC has - trainer, vendor, etc. If they can talk, they will go
up and do the talking animation, without standing at the same place as another
buddy-bot who is currently doing the same thing. So if we spawn a trainer, they
should walk up and train their abilities. The reason for this is that when we
apply the buddy-bot system to wow-chat, which is the more custom version of
wow-chat, we will have dynamically spawned NPCs without any of the default ones.
So they need to be able to handle dynamic interactions, and, eventually, dynamic
towns. But that won't be as hard as you're thinking, no need to panic hehe :)

Can you also give Feldowinn some spellpower gems? Also mp5 and crit rating. Just
for the gear she has currently equipped. Make sure they're level appropriate, we
shuffled the gem level requirements around.

Feldowinn's gems are in her mailbox, and the buddy fixes are in code but need a
rebuild. Matis can't get gear before then. The new designs are written up as
issue files with questions for you.

## Done in game

**Feldowinn's gems (mailed, two mails):** her Platemail set has 16 sockets, 6
red, 5 yellow and 5 blue. Your gem tiers put item-level-50 gear in tier III, so
she has one of these per socket:

| Socket | Gem | Gives |
|---|---|---|
| Red ×6 | Runed Living Ruby | spell power |
| Yellow ×5 | Smooth Dawnstone | crit rating |
| Blue ×5 | Lustrous Star of Elune | mana per 5 |

**Matis's gear:** the console can't dress a bot, so it waits for the rebuild.
Then, as GM, `.buddy kit Matis` gives him the kit's gear for level 46 by his
talent plan, including a weapon.

## Built (syntax-checked, needs your rebuild)

**Dungeons:** buddies stood at the entrance because their roaming setup switches
"follow" off, and that setup was never changed inside a dungeon. Now, inside any
dungeon, raid or battleground, they switch to the bot module's own way of
running one: follow you, attack what you attack and whatever attacks the group,
and play their class's role. That's all the bot module does in dungeons; its
bots never clear one on their own, so you lead the pulls.

**Starting kit:**
- **Mail at level 40:** the kit ran before the buddy learned its spells, so
  plate wasn't wearable yet. Spells are now learned first.
- **Cloth hat:** ties between a cloth hat and a mail helm were broken by item
  number. The heaviest armour the buddy can wear now wins.
- **Cloaks:** a slot with nothing in the 5-level window is now filled from lower
  levels.
- **Weapons:** chosen by class and the talent plan's main tree:
  - Ret paladins get a two-hander; holy and protection get a one-hander and a
    shield.
  - Rogues get daggers or one-handers in both hands.
  - Casters get a staff (or a one-hander and an off-hand item) and a wand.
  - Hunters get a bow, gun or crossbow.

## Answered

**Talents at 25:** that's how it was decided on Sept 26: two points in the main
tree for every one in the other, at every level, with the capstone around level
54. Zearea is 100% Ret, so all her points go to one tree. Do you want to switch
to "main tree first, up to 31, then the other tree"? The question is in the
talent-plan issue.

**Levelling a character down today:** nothing changes. All of the character's
buddies keep logging in at whatever level they are, and Sargobras has nothing to
say about them.

## New issue files (nothing built)

- **`617p-npc-awareness.md`:** buddies notice friendly NPCs within 100 yards,
  read from each creature what it offers (so NPCs spawned in game work), and use
  them: train, sell, repair, or just talk. Each NPC has standing spots, so two
  buddies never stand in the same place.
- **`617a6-buddies-by-stage.md`:** buddies above your current stage are stored
  and don't log in. When you reach their stage again, Sargobras says your line
  and brings them back.
- **`617j2-gems-and-sockets.md`:** stat priorities per class and talent plan;
  buddies start with gems in their sockets, and gem their own gear whenever they
  have a gem and an empty socket.

**Questions for you:**
1. Talent order: switch to main tree first, up to 31?
2. NPC awareness: may noticing pull a buddy up to 100 yards away from you at any
   time, or only when nothing else is going on?
3. NPC awareness: should buddies take quests from quest givers, or only talk to
   them?
4. Stored buddies: do they level along with you while stored, or keep their old
   level?
5. Stored buddies: does it matter how you got to the lower level? (Today only a
   GM command can level a character down.)
6. Gems: fill the head's meta socket, or leave it empty below level-cap gear?
7. Gems: may a buddy replace a gem already socketed? The old gem is destroyed
   when replaced.

Nothing is committed yet.

Ah I see. How about we make it 2:1 odds to put them in the main tree vs off
tree, until either the main tree has reached the bottom tier, or the side talent
tree has reached the number that it would be if the main tree has gotten to that
point?

only if they need the NPC. For the RP talking, let's say that it only happens
sometimes... Not sure how or when right now.

just pretend to talk

keep their old level and gear and such, but when you talk to Sargobras he
"reinitializes them" to their level 40 or 50 or 20 or whatever state - whenever
they were first brought to you.

> 5. Stored buddies: does it matter how you got to the lower level? (Today only

we will add mechanics for that later. For now, let's say it doesn't matter.

I don't think the head gear pieces have meta slots? We shouldn't let them have
meta slots... Not on white gear at least.

> when replaced.

Let's say no, unless nobody in the clan could use the gem better than they
could. Then they can replace the old gem. Though, it also depends on if it's a
more valuable stat for them - how do we calculate that now?

I built your talent rule into the talent spender, and the spender's offline test
passes. Your other answers are recorded in their issues. Two questions are still
open.

## Talents: your 2:1 rule

This applies to buddies whose talent plan is two-thirds in one tree and
one-third in another. Each point:

1. **Until the main tree reaches its bottom row, or the side tree reaches its
   mark:** the point goes to the main tree two times in three, at random, and to
   the side tree otherwise.
   - "Bottom row" is the deepest row your talent cap allows in the main tree,
     and it counts as reached once a point is in it.
   - The side tree's "mark" is half the points it takes to open that bottom row,
     which is the side tree's count at that moment under a 2:1 split.
2. **When one of those two happens:** points go only to the tree that hasn't
   reached its goal yet.
3. **When both have:** points go back to the old exact 2:1 split.

If a tree has no legal talent left, the point goes to the other tree. Plans that
are all-in-one-tree or a third in each are unchanged.

I updated the test to check your rule instead of the old exact split: the side
tree never passes its mark before the main tree reaches its bottom row. It
passes for all 10 classes × 10 plans × 100 random seeds, and every build still
reaches its capstone. Existing buddies keep their current talents until their
next re-roll, which happens when their owner respecs.

## How a gem's value is calculated now

The bot module gives each kind of character (healer, caster, tank, melee damage,
ranged damage) a weight for each stat. Source patch B046 blends those weights by
each buddy's talent plan. A gem's value is its stats multiplied by those
weights, the same sum used for an item's stats. So "more valuable for them"
falls out of that number.

**I read your gem-replacement rule as:** a buddy puts a new gem over an old one
only if (1) the new gem scores higher for it than the old one does, and (2) no
clan-mate would score the new gem higher than it would, in which case the gem
goes to that clan-mate instead. **Is that right?**

## Your other answers, recorded

- **NPC awareness:** a buddy only leaves your side if it needs the NPC
  (training, selling or repair). It only pretends to talk to quest givers.
  Talking for its own sake happens rarely; **when exactly is still open.**
- **Stored buddies:** while stored they keep their level and gear. When
  Sargobras brings them back, they're reset to the moment they were first made:
  that level, its starting kit and lessons, and its talent points. How you got
  to the lower level doesn't matter for now.
- **Meta sockets:** no white or green item has one; only a single grey test item
  does. So nothing changes.

The talent change is in the Lua scripts, so `.reload ale` is enough to take
effect. Nothing is committed yet.

> 3. When both have: points go back to the old exact 2:1 split.

When both have, wouldn't we be completely out of talent points?

Also, I noticed that Feldowinn, my character, might be able to place talent
points in the talents to the side of her capstone. I haven't tried yet, but its
clickable in the talent previewer.

> If a tree has no legal talent left, the point goes to the other tree. Plans

We should change the 1/3rd in each to follow the same principles, except 1/3rd
in each tree until we reach the goal for that tree.

Mostly, For (2) make sure that we're examining the gems in the clan-mate's gear
and we notice an upgrade for them. I am also worried about bots passing gems
back and forth and never slotting one.

Honestly the buddies are rarely right at your side haha, the "areas" are pretty
big that they roam in.

I'm thinking of adding a system that scales your level up or down to play with
higher or lower level characters. City of Heroes has a system like that. But
that's much later work, and in that case we *wouldn't* want to re-instantiate
the buddy-bots, hence why we're recording their equipment and such at the time
of the player character's de-levelling.

What do we need to build before we can re-compile?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nothing more needs building before you recompile. Everything since your last
build is written and passes a syntax-only compile against the real build flags.

## Feldowinn and the talents beside the capstone

The talent-cap rule says row 7 offers only the capstone (the one-point talent,
e.g. Repentance). The multi-rank talents beside it are refused. The talent
previewer is drawn by your game client, which doesn't know the server's rule, so
those talents look clickable there.

Try learning one. The server should refuse it. If it accepts it, that's a bug in
the cap and I'll look into it. Hiding them in the previewer would need a client
patch.

## Your other notes, recorded

- **Third-in-each plans:** built. Each point goes to a random tree still short
  of 17 (a third of the 51 points at level 60). Once all three are at 17, the
  remaining points go to whichever tree is furthest below its third. The offline
  test checks that no tree passes 17 while another can still use points, and it
  passes.
- **Gems:** "an upgrade for a clan-mate" means beating a gem already in one of
  their matching sockets, or filling an empty one, by their own stat weights. To
  stop gems being passed back and forth, the clan places each loose gem once: it
  goes to the member it helps most, who sockets it straight away, and it never
  moves again.
- **Stored buddies:** a buddy's level, gear, spells and talents are recorded at
  the moment it's stored. Sargobras resets it to how it was first made. Your
  later level-scaling system would restore the recorded state instead.
- **NPC awareness:** the 100 yards is measured from the buddy wherever it roams,
  not from you.

## What this rebuild contains

**Source patches:**
- `B047`: Sargobras's outfit.
- `B048`: no "My bags are full" whispers from buddies.

**Buddy module:**
- Pathfinding stages 1–5 and the trace.
- Smooth turning.
- Monster approach, with Carago's stuck-fight fix.
- Spell learning and hunter pets.
- Town baker loading and town circles, with the `.buddy town` commands.
- The selling trip.
- The login watcher.
- The new entrance.
- The kit fixes and `.buddy kit`.
- The dungeon follow fix.

**Install steps** (run by the update):
- `E049` bakes the towns (you've already run it by hand).
- `E050` loads the town circles into the database.

**Lua only** (`.reload ale` is enough, no rebuild): the talent rules,
Sargobras's spoken naming, and the gossip trace.

After the restart, `.buddy kit Matis` dresses Matis. Nothing is committed yet.

### User Request 36

I thought there were some source-files we needed to change for something...?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The only source-file changes are the two patches I wrote today. Both are ready,
and your build applies them by itself, so you don't need to edit any source
files by hand.

- **`B047`, Sargobras's outfit:** changes the server's mirror-image handler
  (`SpellHandler.cpp`) and adds a header listing which creatures wear which
  look.
- **`B048`, quiet bags:** changes the bot module's failed-item whisper
  (`InventoryChangeFailureAction.cpp`).

Both are in the basic profile's patch list. Their anchor lines appear exactly
once in the current source, and both applied and reverted cleanly on copies of
the real files.

One thing I noticed while checking: the source tree isn't clean right now.
`Player.cpp` and 23 bot-module files still have earlier patches applied (`B004`,
`B012`, `B019`; warning fixes such as `uint8 i` becoming `int i`). The last
build seems not to have run its revert step. It doesn't block the rebuild: each
patch skips itself if it's already applied, and the revert runs after the build.
If it's still there after this rebuild, the revert step needs looking at.

The other source change we talked about was patching the bot module so buddies
auto-learn spells on level-up (the option 1 I suggested early on). You chose the
Lua route, and the spell learning ended up in the buddy module instead, so that
patch was never needed.

Your source tree is clean now, and builds will stay clean. Ten of the 42 source
patches still need their reverts or applies rewritten, which I haven't done.

**What I changed:**
- `scripts/compile`: every build now ends by resetting the source to upstream,
  whether it succeeds or fails. Before the reset it prints a warning naming any
  file a patch's revert left changed. Your source tree is clean as of now.
- `scripts/verify-patches` (new): for each source patch, starting from clean
  upstream source, it applies the patch, applies it again, reverts it, and
  compares against upstream. It's the upstream-patch method's own check.

**What `verify-patches` found for basic:** 29 of 42 patches are fine.

| Problem | Patches | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| Revert changes upstream's own lines | B004, B012, B013, B014, B016, B018, B019, B021 | Each reverses its fix by pattern-matching the "fixed" form. Upstream has since written some of those same lines that way, so the revert changes upstream's own code (24 bot-module files and `Player.cpp`). |
| Applying twice changes more | B013, B014, B022 | They have no "already applied" check. Each build applies them once to a fresh tree, so this doesn't break builds, but they don't meet the method's rule. |
| Can't apply alone | B045, B048 | Expected: both need B044's header, and the check tests each patch by itself. |

Nearly all the faulty ones are old compile-warning fixes, and upstream has
adopted much of what they fix. So the real fix is to rewrite each one with
marked edits and an exact revert (the method's standard shape), and retire
whichever parts upstream now covers.

That's about ten patches to rewrite. With the reset in place nothing is broken
meanwhile. Rewrite them now, or after you've tested this rebuild? Nothing is
committed yet.

The patches are rewritten and every one of basic's 37 passes the round-trip
check. Applying and reverting the whole list together leaves the source exactly
as upstream wrote it.

**What changed:**
- **Six patches** (`B004`, `B012`, `B013`, `B014`, `B018`, `B021`) are now
  tables of exact whole-line edits, run by one shared helper in `patches.sh`:
  - Applying tags each changed line with the patch's ID.
  - Reverting only touches tagged lines.
  - If an old line isn't found exactly the expected number of times, the patch
    stops and reports itself stale instead of guessing.
- **Two fixes beyond the reverts:**
  - `B013` was changing a condition's meaning in today's upstream: bots judged
    flag carriers by the wrong team. That edit is dropped.
  - `B014`'s inserted `default: break;` is dropped; a cast on the same switch
    already stops the warning.
- **Two patches retired:**
  - `B016`: upstream now has all of it.
  - `B019`: three of its edits handed constructors a garbage pointer, and the
    rest did nothing. Its file is renamed `.retired.sh-retired`.
- **`B022`** got "already applied" checks per file, so applying it twice changes
  nothing.
- **`B045` and `B048`** now declare `# Needs: B044` in their headers, and
  `scripts/verify-patches` applies a patch's prerequisites first.
- The build still ends by resetting the source, and warns if any revert leaves
  something behind.

The build doesn't treat warnings as errors, so the dropped warning fixes can't
break it.

**Other profiles:** vanilla (17) and release (15) pass. Beta has one failure
that was there before today: `B008` links a talent-bonus module that isn't in
the project. To fix, either restore that module or take `B008` out of beta's
list. Your call.

**Todo list, after this:**
1. NPC awareness.
2. Buddies by stage.
3. Gems and sockets.
4. **New:** full bags in a dungeon. The buddy gives its most valuable
   vendor-or-auction item to a clan-mate. Failing that, it destroys its least
   valuable item, unless the loot is worth even less, in which case it leaves
   the loot where it is. I'll write it into the selling-trip issue first.

These are big, so I'll take them one at a time, each with a syntax check,
starting with NPC awareness. Or you can recompile first and test what's already
in. Nothing is committed yet.

Replacing one shortcut I took: with no floor in front of a person, the buddy now
skips that person, rather than standing beside them.

### Session Recap (written by the harness, not by either speaker)

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of
context. The summary below covers the earlier portion of the conversation.

Summary:
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   The user (gabrilend, owner of the Everland Ghostsong project, a WoW 3.3.5a
   AzerothCore server with a "basic" profile and "buddy-bot" companions) ran a
   long live development/testing session. Her current explicit request (latest):
   build four things in order and "Tell me when they're finished so I can
   recompile":
   - 617p NPC awareness (buddies notice friendly NPCs within 100 yd of
     themselves, read offers from the creature, use them when needed:
     train/sell/repair; rare pretend talk; standing-spot claims).
   - 617a6 buddies by stage (store buddies above owner's stage; Sargobras line
     "Oh it looks like you already have a buddy-bot for this stage of your
     journey. Here let me summon them..." re-enables and reinitializes them to
     first-made state; record state at de-level time for future level-scaling).
   - 617j2 gems and sockets (stat priorities per plan; gems at creation;
     self-socketing; clan places loose gems once to member gaining most,
     examining clan-mates' socketed gems; no ping-pong; no meta sockets on
     whites).
   - Full bags in a dungeon (new, task 19): "if a buddy-bot's inventory is full
     while in a dungeon, they should try and give their most valuable item (that
     they would otherwise sell to a vendor or auction) to a clan mate. Failing
     that, they should destroy their least valuable item unless the item they're
     trying to loot is less valuable, in which case they will just leave it on
     the body or chest or whatever." (Write into 617h1 issue first.)
   Earlier requests (done): wine fix, network/realm setup, Sargobras
   naming/outfit, kit, spells, pathfinding stages 1–5, trace, town baker, town
   circles with wisps, entrance, login keeper, selling trip, dungeon follow,
   talent 2:1 and thirds rules, patch-system cleanup.

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - AzerothCore + mod-playerbots + mod-ale (Lua, pinned July 2026); project
     module modules/mod-buddies (copied into source-beta by B036);
     upstream-patch system (patches/B*.sh source patches, E-patches.sh install
     steps, patches.sh lists/probes; compile applies, reverts, now resets).
   - Navigation mesh (Detour) via PathGenerator; server straight-line fallback
     on NOPATH caused wall-walking.
   - Bot strategies (follow, buddy roam, buddy travel, buddy town, grind),
     PlayerbotAI ChangeEngine/Attack.
   - Coded gossip box answers never sent by client → spoken /say naming.
   - Mirror-image (UNIT_FLAG2_MIRROR_IMAGE, SMSG_MIRRORIMAGE_DATA) for custom
     NPC looks.
   - Lua hot reload `.reload ale`; GM SOAP tool scripts/gm-command.
   - Syntax check script:
     /tmp/claude-1000/-mnt-mtwo-games-azeroth-core-wow-chat-2026/ac2bf3cc-364a-4384-a952-e3550028e78d/scratchpad/syntax-check.sh
     <file.cpp>... (uses build-shadow/compile_commands.json; for core-file
     checks strip PCH flags).
   - Issue workflow (issue-lifecycle skill): issue before change, Current
     Behavior kept true, claim-own-change for script/sed edits, commit only via
     /home/ritz/programming/ai-stuff/scripts/commit-own-changes.

3. Files and Code Sections (main ones created/changed this session; all
   uncommitted):

   - PSendSysMessage/const name clashes (SLOT_SHIRT→OUTFIT_*,
     FACTION_FRIENDLY→WISP_FACTION).
   - Baker inside module folder would be compiled into server (moved to tools/).
   - Baker counted starting valleys as towns → shared buddy_town_rules.h.
   - Empty bakes → no file written.
   - Gem mail >12 stacks → split mails.

   clan naming (spoken), source tree dirtiness (reset + exact reverts).

7. Pending Tasks:
   - Task 16 (in progress): finish 617p — update issues/617p-npc-awareness.md
     Current Behavior (built, syntax-checked), mark done.
   - Task 17: build 617a6 buddies by stage (roster columns
     stored/made_level/reinit via new characters SQL + E-step; login/keeper skip
     stored; level-down logs out & stores via OnPlayerLevelChanged; Sargobras
     Lua returning-slot option with the line; C++ reinit on login: level to
     made_level, regear, relearn, talent reset).
   - Task 18: build 617j2 gems and sockets.
   - Task 19: dungeon full-bags rule (write into 617h1 first, then build).
   - Then tell user everything is finished so she can recompile.
   - Awaiting user: Marvaria pacing fix yes/no; 617j1 and 617e10 open questions;
     617p talk timing; beta B008 left as is.
   - Later: remove temp tools (gossip-trace.lua, jeweler-spot-reader.lua-done,
     INTID_NAME_BOX) after a commit; commit work.

8. Current Work:
   Just finished writing 617p NPC awareness: buddies_npcs.h/.cpp and the
   NpcErrand in buddies_roam_strategy.cpp; syntax check output "==
   buddies_npcs.cpp" and "== buddies_roam_strategy.cpp" with no errors. The
   no-floor fallback was replaced with release-and-skip. Next step in that task:
   update 617p issue Current Behavior and mark task 16 complete.

9. Optional Next Step:
   Update issues/617p-npc-awareness.md Current Behavior to describe the built
   system, mark task 16 completed, then start task 17 (617a6 buddies by stage),
   per the user's request: "can we start work on these too? Can you add them to
   your todo list?" and "great! Tell me when they're finished so I can
   recompile."

All four are built and you can recompile. Each one compiles in the syntax check,
but none has run in game yet. Nothing is committed.

**1. Buddies notice the people around them**
- Every 5 seconds a roaming buddy looks at the friendly people within 100 yards
  of itself. It reads what each one offers from the person, so people spawned in
  game count too.
- It goes to the one it needs most: lessons it can afford, then selling if its
  bags are 90% full, then repairs if any gear is below half durability, then
  gems for empty sockets. A chat happens on a 3% roll per look.
- Each person has three standing spots in front of them, and a buddy claims one.
  A spot with no floor under it is skipped; there is no fallback spot.

**2. Buddies by stage**
- When the owner's level drops below a slot's level, that slot's buddy logs out
  and stays out. A few seconds later a copy of it is saved to new tables: level,
  experience, money, every item with its gems and enchants, spells and talents.
  That copy is for the level-scaling later.
- When the owner climbs back to that level, a wandering Sargobras comes for the
  slot. Talking to him gets his line ("Oh, it looks like you already have a
  buddy-bot for this stage of your journey. Here, let me summon them...") and
  the buddy comes back.
- At that login it is reset to how it was first made:
  - its items and money are removed and its lessons forgotten;
  - its level goes back to its made level, its talents are reset and re-spent;
  - its lessons and starting kit are given again;
  - it walks in from behind Sargobras with the same greeting it gave the first
    time.
- The new database columns and tables are applied by the existing install step
  when the server starts. I ran that SQL twice on a throwaway copy of the
  characters database (dropped afterwards) and took one copy of a buddy there:
  26 items, 84 spells, 14 talents.

**3. Gems and sockets**
- A new buddy's starting gear, and a returning buddy's, gets every socket
  filled, free, with gems of the item's tier: +4 below item level 30, +6 below
  45, +8 from 45.
- Gems are chosen by the bot module's own stat weights for each talent tree in
  the buddy's plan, weighted by the plan's thirds. If matching the socket
  colours and earning the socket bonus adds up to more, it does that instead.
- Every 10 seconds, for each owner, the one loose gem that would most improve
  one of their online buddies is socketed into that buddy's gear. It is handed
  over first if another buddy held it, and goes through the server's own
  socketing.
- A socketed gem never moves again, so gems can't be passed back and forth. No
  meta gems are ever used.
- The gem code only compiles when the stat-weight source patch (B046) is
  applied. I applied it briefly to check, then took it off; the source tree is
  back to clean, and your build applies it as usual.
- A new test, `scripts/test-buddy-gems`, passes. It only checks the database
  (each tier has gems, no white item has a meta socket), not which gem a plan
  picks.

**4. Full bags in a dungeon**
When a buddy opens a body or chest in a dungeon and its bags can't hold an item:
1. It gives its most valuable item it would sell or auction anyway to another of
   the owner's buddies in the same dungeon who has room.
2. Failing that, it destroys its least valuable such item, unless the loot is
   worth even less; then it leaves the loot where it lies.
3. With nothing it would part with, it leaves the loot.

Value is the vendor price of the whole stack. One known gap: two items that each
fit alone but not together only get room made for the first; the second stays on
the body.

**Open questions, written into the issues:**
1. **Return level:** a buddy made above its slot's level (for example, filled at
   35 for the level-20 slot) would come back at 35 while its owner is 20. I
   capped it at the owner's level when it returns. Is that right?
2. **The owner and gems:** is the owner a clan-mate for gems? Right now gems
   only go between buddies, and the owner's sockets are never filled for them.
3. **Buying gems:** basic's +4 gems moved from the capital vendors to
   prospecting, so only a few vendors still sell gems. Should buddies buy gems
   at all?
4. **Chatting:** when should a buddy chat with someone for no reason? It's a 3%
   roll per look for now.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### User Request 42

Alright we got a lot of issue files open since September 25th. Can you give me a
report on where they stand? Are they still open because of housekeeping, or are
they incomplete? What can be done to finish up the easiest ones?

> 1. Return level: a buddy made above its slot's level (for example, filled at
> 35 for the level-20 slot) would
     come back at 35 while its owner is 20. I capped it at the owner's level when it returns. Is that right?

I don't think so? Basically if the owner is 35 and the buddy bot is 35, then the
owner gets dropped to level 20, then only their first 3 buddy-bots would stick
around. The level 35 buddy-bot would hang out and wait until they got to level
35, and then they would start spawning again. I guess we don't need Sargobras to
show up, just wait until the owner is the same level as the buddy-bot.

> 2. The owner and gems: is the owner a clan-mate for gems? Right now gems only

jewelcrafters who are passing around the gems they made can give them to the
owner if they want.

from the auction house, when they have spare slots. Also we're going to add
behavior for buddy-bots talking to each other *if they're from a different clan*
when they run into each other while adventuring. They'll stand a bit apart
facing each other +/- 15 degrees or so, and send /say messages about what they
have, what they can do, etc. Then they might make trades and such. In such a
case, they could find a jewelcrafter and get some gems from them. Maybe we
should remove the auction house entirely?? but that's later, once we have LLM
responses and personalities and such for the bots, so that players can talk to
them too and get stuff from them.

> 4. Chatting: when should a buddy chat with someone for no reason? It's a 3%

3% doesn't seem like very much. I think they should try and visit that person
more often... I think they should visit each NPC at least once, and only test to
see what they do the first time they arrive. If it's a vendor, they'll sell the
stuff they don't need. If it's a trainer, they'll train up if they can. If it's
just an NPC, they'll just talk to them. We should cycle out the remembered NPCs
every 30 minutes or so. Is that a bad system? Maybe. Let's see how it goes.

I've written your four answers into their issues; the code doesn't follow them
yet. I'll rebuild once you've answered the questions at the end.

# Open issues since September 25: where they stand

About 70 issues were opened since September 25; I've also counted the buddy and
basic-profile parent issues opened on the 23rd and 24th. Almost none are open
for lack of code. Most are open because of one of these:

- **Waiting to be seen in game.** The code is built, but the issue's "Current
  Behavior" still says "not yet compiled or run". Several of these probably
  *have* run during your play sessions, so the issue text is just stale.
- **Waiting on your next compile.** Today's work.
- **Partly built**, with a known piece left.
- **Plans only**, never meant to be built yet.

## 1. Probably done, only the paperwork is behind

Each needs you to confirm it works; then I rewrite the issue as built and move
it to completed.

| Issue | What's left |
|---|---|
| Buddy module and roster tables | The "buddies are ON" startup line. Buddies clearly exist, so it's working. |
| Companion account | Buddies live on hidden accounts; seen working. |
| Buddy creation | Buddies are being made; seen working. |
| Sargobras's class/people menu | Used repeatedly; seen working. |
| Clan naming | Spoken naming worked for Karson. Remove the temporary packet-log script and box-test option, then close. |
| Talent plans | Talent test passes and Feldowinn's buddies spent their points. |
| Roaming core in game | Seen running (Mozonn). Its walking was rewritten today by the mesh work, so it closes with that. |
| No mounts in towns | **Withdrawn by you on Sept 27.** Can move to completed now, marked withdrawn. |

## 2. Built and compiled, never confirmed in game

Each needs one quick check in game.

- **No dual spec, uncapped respec:** is there a dual-spec option at a trainer at
  60? What do respecs cost?
- **No world channels:** are General and Trade gone?
- **Outland ability tomes:** also needs its per-ability scaling review.
- **Hiding creatures from one player** (Sargobras vanishing in Acherus).
- **Proximity party:** buddies join within range, leave past 75 yards or in
  towns.
- **Loyalty:** a stranger's invite gets "Thanks, but I stay with my clan."
- **Quest mirroring:** buddies get the owner's quest rewards.
- **Town visits and the auction house:** errands, selling, auctions, mail.
- **Battlegrounds:** buddies queue with the owner.
- **Following across continents, and boarding recordings:** boats and zeppelins.
- **Creatures, chests and nodes:** gathering, plus the monster part (now
  replaced by the approach).
- **Exploration modes:** rooms indoors.
- **Secondary professions:** Cooking, First Aid, Fishing at creation.

## 3. Written today, waiting on your compile

- Mesh-based walking: the five navmesh stages.
- Town circles with wisps.
- The selling trip, and full bags in a dungeon.
- Spell learning.
- Starting kit fixes.
- The new entrance gestures.
- The login keeper.
- Instance following.
- Sargobras's outfit.
- NPC awareness.
- Buddies by stage.
- Gems.

Three of these change with your answers today: NPC visits, stage return, and gem
buying.

## 4. Partly built, with deferred pieces

- **Loot rolls and upgrades:** giving gear within the clan and handing class
  books to the owner aren't built; 3 open questions.
- **Auction house:** 3 open questions.
- **Professions:** primary professions and crafting are unclear; this needs a
  read-through.
- **Gear gallery (3D models):** blocked on ComfyUI's install. Texturing,
  skeleton borrowing, generated animations and the scenic vista command aren't
  built.
- **Zone view from above:** built and published; only its card in the roaming
  gallery is missing.
- **Server stop logging:** built. A proposed ID-counter check is still open.
- **Neuron spawn bridge:** the wrapper exists, but neuron's generator doesn't
  call it (open questions).

## 5. Plans only (by your choice)

- Cross-server friends and guilds (pinned).
- Northrend at sixty.
- Capital glyph traders.
- Battleground rewards.
- Aldor and Scryer by deeds.
- Faction by reputation.
- Buddy task hunts (needs the language-model work).
- Kraken tactics in game.
- Closer in danger.
- Loot turns.

## Easiest to finish, in order

1. **Close "No mounts in towns" as withdrawn.** Pure housekeeping, no code.
2. **Close the six from section 1** once you confirm, from what you've seen,
   that they work. I'll also remove the temporary naming tools in that pass.
3. **Add the zone-view card to the roaming gallery.** Small, and that issue is
   then done.
4. **A 5-minute in-game checklist after your compile** covers most of section 2:
   - visit a trainer at 60 (dual spec, respec price);
   - look at your chat channels;
   - invite someone else's buddy;
   - turn in a quest and check your buddies' logs;
   - queue for Warsong Gulch;
   - take a boat.

   Each one that passes closes an issue. I can write this up as a page you tick
   through.
5. **Answer the open questions** in the auction house and loot-rolls issues (3
   each). Those are what's blocking them, not code.

## Before I rebuild for your answers

Two questions on buddies by stage:

- **Does the reset still happen anywhere?** Should Sargobras's "let me summon
  them" and the reset to how a buddy was first made still happen in some case?
  Or does "wait until the owner reaches the buddy's level, then it comes back as
  it is" replace both?
- **What about buddies already in the lower slots?** In your example, the owner
  is at 35 with buddies at 35, then drops to 20. The first three slots (levels
  1, 10, 20) stay with them, but those buddies are also level 35. Is that
  intended: lower slots stay out at any level, and only the higher slots wait?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### User Request 43

> - Loyalty: a stranger's invite gets "Thanks, but I stay with my clan."

this reminds me, I noticed something during the live test. We should be able to
override the dynamic party system by inviting bots to our group. In addition, we
should be able to invite party member's clan-members if we'd like, and they
should stay in our group. So, Sue invites Tracy, and Kyle is Tracy's buddy bot.
Sue can invite Kyle under the proposed system, and he'll adventure with both of
them.

Also, if a player is invited to a group, or two players, or up to 3 other
players for a total of 4 players in a group, we should still keep the dynamic
party grouping with their buddy-bots active. So let's say they're all level 60
and they have all their buddy-bots - basically, the empty party slots would be
filled by whichever bots were in range from among the player's clans.

only the higher slots wait. Everyone gets re-instantiated to the highest level

Your answers and the invite change are all built and pass the syntax check, so
you can recompile. None has run in game yet, and nothing is committed.

**Inviting buddies now works whatever party they're in.** I couldn't confirm
from the logs what failed in your live test. My guess is the server refused the
invite because the buddy was already grouped, since the distance grouping keeps
buddies in parties.
- These invites are allowed:
  - the owner inviting their own buddy;
  - anyone in a group with the owner (Sue, grouped with Tracy) inviting that
    owner's buddy (Kyle).
- The inviter must lead the group or be an assistant, as the game requires for
  any invite.
- An allowed invite always works now: the buddy leaves whatever it's in (a
  battleground, its own far party, or its owner's party) and is seated in the
  inviter's group.
- It counts as invited by hand, so the distance grouping never takes it out
  again, towns included.
- It's seated directly, so the bot module's "Hello" and its permission check
  against non-masters don't get in the way.
- If the group is full, the buddy stays where it is.
- Strangers still get "Thanks, but I stay with my clan."

**Groups with several players:** out in the world this already worked. Each
player's buddies within 60 yards of their own owner fill the group's empty
seats, whoever leads it. One known effect: if there are more buddies in range
than seats, the first owner on the list fills first.

**When an owner's level drops** (owner 35 with buddies at 35, dropped to 20):
- **Higher slots wait.** The slot-30 buddy leaves the world, unchanged, and
  comes back by itself when the owner reaches 35, its own level.
- **Kept slots are re-made.** The buddies in slots 1, 10 and 20 are re-made at
  level 20: their gear and money are taken, then they're re-taught, re-kitted
  and re-gemmed the way a new buddy is made. They briefly log out and back in
  for this.
- Every buddy is recorded first: level, gear, spells, talents.
- Sargobras's line, the reset to how a buddy was first made, and the special
  entrance are all gone.
- I read "the highest level tier they could spawn as" as the owner's current
  level, since buddies are made at their owner's level.

**Visiting people:** the 3% chat roll is gone.
- A buddy visits each person it notices once and decides what to do when it
  arrives:
  - at a vendor, it sells what it doesn't need;
  - at a trainer, it trains what it can afford;
  - at a repairer, it repairs anything damaged;
  - otherwise it chats.
- It remembers whom it visited for 30 minutes. A need (affordable lessons, full
  bags, worn gear) still takes it to the right person even if it visited
  recently.

**Gems:** buying at vendors is replaced by buying at the auction house during
the town visit's auction errand.
- It only buys while more than 2 bag slots are free, and spends at most a
  quarter of its money per visit. Both numbers are my guesses, logged in the
  balance file.
- It buys the best single gem listed for each empty socket. The gems arrive by
  mail and get socketed on the next clan pass.

One new open question, in the dungeon-draw issue: when two players enter a
dungeon together, should each player's buddies fill the empty seats, as they do
outside now? The draw currently leaves a group with two or more players alone,
from your September 24 rule.

It should never leave it's owners party when invited to a different party. The
owner has priority. God, we gotta think of a different word than "owner".
Buddy-bots should only ever be in parties if their player-partner is in that
party.

Also, if there's 5 players in a party and another player or buddy-bot is
invited, we should remove one of the dynamically added buddy-bots at random to
make space. If there are none, then we know that everyone in the party was
manually invited, and we shouldn't drop anyone.

whenever there's space created in a dynamic group, we should select a valid
buddy-bot at random from within the radius. If there's none who aren't in a
group, then we do nothing until one is. How are we checking for that by the way?
Can we make like, custom hook triggers or something for when a character enters
a zone / radius from another creature? Or are we polling periodically? I could
see that being a performance drain. Much better, in general, to follow a stream
of data rather than ask for it.

Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm, the more I think about it, the more I think we should just
treat them all the same, and re-initialize the level 35 guy too when the
player-partner reaches level 30. At level 30.

How about we build a double-buffer system, and a server-wide 15 minute timer.

when the timer expires, then we swap buffers and clear the older of the two. New
entries go to the newly emptied buffer, and buddy-bots treat both buffers as
valid.

The buffers are per-buddy, but they're swapped globally.

If their inventory is full when they're at the auction house, then something
went seriously wrong with their todo list - my understanding was that full or
nearly full inventories make vendors the highest priority? I guess we could also
auction items at the auction house while we're there, to clear space... But if
there's no room, they should go to the nearest vendor haha and then come back.

Yes they should. Please ensure there's at least one tank and healer too. Player
talents should be summed per tree, and whichever one has the most points should
be counted as their spec for the purposes of this check. Though we should
probably abstract that functionality because we'll probably need it elsewhere.

All of it is built and passes the syntax check, so you can recompile. None of it
has run in game, and nothing is committed.

**Parties**
- **Partner's party first.** An invite only ever puts a buddy into a group its
  player-partner is in, so it can never pull a buddy out of its partner's party.
  Out of a far party or a battleground, yes.
- **Full parties make room.** Any invite into a full party, of a player or a
  buddy, first takes out one buddy the distance grouping added, at random, and
  then the invite goes through. If every member was invited by hand, nobody is
  dropped and the server says the party is full.
- **Seats fill at random.** A free seat goes to a random buddy among all the
  ungrouped buddies within 60 yards of their own partner, whose partner is in
  that group. It no longer goes to the nearest buddy, or partner by partner. If
  no buddy is free, the seat waits.
- **Freed seats fill straight away.** When anyone leaves a group, the server's
  own "member left" moment triggers the filling on the next update, instead of
  waiting for the next 5-second check.

**Dungeons with several players**
- The group's empty seats are filled from every player's buddies.
- A tank comes first if the group has none, then a healer, then the rest, taking
  turns between the players' draw bags.
- A player's spec is the talent tree with the most points spent. That's now a
  small shared piece (`buddies_roles.cpp`) that anything else can use.

**Buddies by stage**
- **All treated the same.** Your level-35 buddy waits, and when you reach 30 it
  comes back made again at 30.
- **Old gear by mail.** Everything it wore and carried, bags and money included,
  is mailed to itself as "Kept for you". At a mailbox it only takes out what it
  can use at its level now; the rest stays in the mail until it levels into it.
- That mail alone doesn't send it to the mailbox until something in it fits.

**Visiting people**
- Repairers that are also vendors already got both: on arrival a buddy sells and
  repairs.
- The memory is now your double buffer: two buffers per buddy, swapped
  server-wide every 15 minutes, so a visit is remembered for 15 to 30 minutes.
- I do the swap lazily. The server clock counts 15-minute turns, and a buddy's
  old buffer is cleared the first time that buddy looks in a new turn. That
  behaves the same as clearing everyone at once, without touching buddies that
  aren't looking.

**What's a clan pass?** Every 10 seconds, for each player-partner online, the
server looks at the loose gems in all of that partner's buddies' bags. It takes
the one gem that improves some buddy the most, compared with what that buddy has
socketed now, hands it over if needed, and sockets it. One gem per partner per
pass.

**Polling or events?** Polling, every 5 seconds per partner. That's a few
distance checks against at most seven buddies, and the roster is cached, so it
costs very little. The server has no "came within N yards" event; its own
visibility updates are the same kind of periodic check, about once a second.
"Member left a group", map changes and invites are now events. Making the radius
itself an event would mean patching the server's visibility code. What would you
want an event like that to carry: just "came within 60 yards of their partner",
or something more general you could reuse elsewhere?

**Questions** (written into the issues):
1. **Far parties:** you said buddies should only be in parties their partner is
   in. Taken literally, that ends far parties (buddies far from their partner
   grouping with each other to share experience, your rule from September 27).
   Should they go? I've kept them for now.
2. **Gems and bag space:** auction-house purchases arrive by mail, not into the
   bags, so bag room only matters at the mailbox. The mailbox errand comes
   before the auction house in the town visit. Should I drop the "more than 2
   free slots" rule at buying time, and instead send the buddy to a vendor when
   the mailbox can't fit its mail?
3. **A word for "owner":** you used "player-partner" yourself. Should I use
   "partner" in issues, comments and when talking to you? Renaming it in the
   code would be a large mechanical change; I'd leave the code alone unless you
   want that too.
4. **Feral druid players:** I count them as tanks for the dungeon check. Is that
   right?
5. **Old-gear mail:** mail lasts 30 days, then goes back to its sender, which
   here is the buddy itself. Gear it takes longer than that to level into might
   be lost. Is that acceptable?

jeez a check every 10 seconds for something that only happens every, what, hour
or two of play? Maybe longer? How about we check whenever an item enters a
buddy-bots bags, and depending on what it is, we have a dispatch table (with
potentials for multiple types of functions, one after another) of things that we
want to check or do? Something like... build a dispatch table in lua cached for
everyone, and have each "item type" be a key. First, run whatever function(s)
are at the item type key, then next maybe the required level key, or maybe the
whatever... So if it's a gem, it's item type would be "gemstone" or something
right? So in the table, we'd have the function in the "item type" slot for
"gemstone" be "check to see if you need it, and if not, then check to see if any
of your clanmates needs it". The idea is, we want to use as few if checks as
possible, and route our decisions through data rather than run a bunch of checks
if this, then that style. But once we're routed to a function, it's okay to have
if checks there.

seven buddies, *per max level player*.

Something like... We register a particular game-object as having a radius. This
radius is the kind of radius that triggers when another gameobject enters it's
field. It runs these functions, A, B, and C, with these arguments, 1, 2, and 3,
every time an object enters the radius. Could do other such things like "when a
spell is cast on this item" or whatever. Do you think that would be performant?

No they stay. Good point. Let's not take it too literally, only contextually,
when we were talking about other players inviting other clan's buddy-bots when
that particular player-partner was not in the group.

Whenever an item enters the mailbox, visiting the mailbox should be made a valid

It's fine I guess. Make it an open issue that we need to replace the "owner"

Done; you can recompile. All of it passes the syntax check (gems with the
stat-weight patch applied briefly, then taken off again). None of it has run in
game, and nothing is committed.

**Spec ties** – the role reader now returns every tree tied for the most
points, plus every role those trees allow. That's the "tuple" you suggested, as
a set. When a caller needs a single tree, it gets one of the tied ones at
random. For the dungeon check, a tied player counts as every role they could
take, and a feral druid counts as both tank and damage.

**Gems, no more timer** – nothing checks every 10 seconds any more.
- **Trigger:** whenever an item enters a buddy's bags (loot, quest rewards,
  purchases, crafting, a hand-over between buddies, or an item taken from the
  mail), it's queued and handled on the server's next update.
- **Routing:** handling goes through a table. Each "reader" turns the item into
  a key (the first reader uses its kind), and every function listed under that
  key runs in turn.
  - **gem:** "do I need it, and if not, does a clanmate", then it's socketed.
  - **armour or weapon with sockets:** the clan's loose gems are offered again 5
    seconds later, once the bot has equipped it.
- To route a new kind of item, add a key, or add a new reader such as required
  level or quality with its own table.
- **Known gap:** gems already loose in bags before this build won't be placed
  until a socketed item arrives in the clan.
- **Buying:** the "spare bag slots" rule at the auction house is gone. Bought
  gems arrive by mail, and waiting mail already puts the mailbox on the town
  visit's to-do list.

**Old-gear mail** now lasts 900 days.

**Far parties** stay. The answer is in the issue.

**Renaming "owner"** – new issue: rename "owner" to "partner" everywhere a
person reads it, about 1,400 uses across code, tables, logs, issues and docs. It
includes a script-made list of every use and a test that fails while any old use
is left.

**Radius triggers: would they be fast enough?** Yes, if they piggyback on what
the server already does. Every moving unit already tells the creatures around it
that it moved; that's how a monster notices you enter its aggro radius. A
registered radius would just be one more listener on that same notice. It costs
only when something moves, and nothing for objects with no radius registered.
"When a spell is cast on this" would hook in the same way at the spell's
landing. It's a server patch in its own right, so it would need its own issue.
Should I write one?

**One question back:** you asked for the dispatch table in Lua. I built it in
C++ because the gem function needs the bot module's stat-weight scoring and the
server's socketing, and both exist only in C++. Moving the table to Lua would
mean exposing the module's functions to the Lua engine, one binding each. Is
that worth doing now, or keep it in C++ until more item kinds get routed?

that's fine I suppose. Conceptually it made more sense to me in lua but if you

### Assistant Response 46

> Writing the radius-trigger issue now.

**The error:** the server was asked to move a Kodo Matriarch (creature 2974, a
level 11 Barrens kodo) while its movement speed was effectively zero, so it
refused that move.

- **How a move works:** the server builds a path and sets the speed along it
  from the creature's current speed. Before sending it, it checks the speed is
  above 0.01 yards per second. That check is what failed.
- **Not its data:** the kodo's normal speeds in the database are fine (walk 1,
  run 1.14). So something took its speed to zero while it was alive and being
  told to move.
- **Likely cause:** slows stacking to 100% while it was chasing or fleeing.
- **Not its own script:** its only scripted action is casting one spell at the
  start of combat.
- **Effect:** none beyond the log line. The creature stands still for that move
  and the next one works once the slow wears off. It only matters if it floods
  the log. If it does, tell me what was fighting it (a buddy, which class), and
  I can look for which effect takes speed to zero.

**Radius triggers:** I wrote the issue for it,
`issues/165-object-radius-and-event-triggers.md`. It's filed as server
infrastructure, next to the per-player hidden creatures. In short:
- You give any creature, object or player a trigger. Each trigger has a kind
  ("enters radius" or "leaves radius" to start), a radius, a filter for who
  counts, and a list of actions with their arguments, run in order and looked up
  from a table.
- It hooks into the server's existing "this unit moved" notice. So it costs
  nothing for objects without triggers, there's no timer, and other modules or
  Lua can register actions.
- The first job for it would be "a buddy came within 60 yards of its partner",
  replacing that part of the 5-second check.
- It has two open questions: whether a trigger on a moving player fires
  correctly from both sides, and which actions should exist from the start.

**Lua versus C++:** it's in C++ but laid out the way you described in Lua:
readers turn the item into keys, and each key has a list of functions. If more
item kinds start using it later, moving the table into Lua is still possible.

### Assistant Response 47

Two things are worth deciding before you go:

1. **Nothing from this session is committed.** It's a lot of uncommitted work
   across the module, patches, SQL, Lua and issues. Your rule is to commit only
   when an issue is complete, and none of these are done until they've been seen
   in game. Commits can still carry in-progress work with the issues marked "in
   progress". Should I commit now in a few themed batches (patches, walking on
   the mesh, towns, party and stage, gems and loot, issues), or wait until after
   your compile and test? The temporary packet-log script, the jeweler-spot
   reader and Sargobras's typed-name test option can only be removed after their
   first commit.

2. **Your next session starts with a compile.** The tree is unpatched and clean,
   ready for `scripts/compile`. New files will make it re-run cmake by itself.
   Once the server is up, the first things worth watching are:
   - buddies walking without going through walls;
   - inviting a buddy that's already in a party;
   - a buddy visiting a vendor or trainer it notices;
   - a dungeon with two players.

Open questions still waiting on you are written into their issues; nothing needs
an answer tonight. Two are new from today:
- "Partner" or "player-partner" in names for the rename issue.
- Which actions the radius triggers should start with.
