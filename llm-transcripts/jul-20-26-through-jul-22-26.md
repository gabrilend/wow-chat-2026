### User Request 1

hi can you read the server logs and tell me if any of them had any errors?

I read the live logs for the active **vanilla** profile (`tmp/logs-vanilla/`).
Here's the verdict:

## No real errors — everything logged is benign

**Auth.log** — Clean. Connected to MySQL fine, all four realms registered.

**Server.log** (worldserver) — Started cleanly, `World Initialized In 0
Minutes 55 Seconds`, reached `ready...`. The only non-info lines are all
harmless:
- `Can't set process priority class, error: Permission denied` — just means it
  wasn't launched as root. Cosmetic.
- `StartHeroicPlayerLevel` (55) and `RecruitAFriend.MaxLevel` (60) failed
  validation, defaults used — because they exceed the vanilla level cap of 40,
  so the engine clamps them.
- ~12 `Level X ... in lfg_dungeon_rewards can never be reached` lines — same
  root cause: dungeon reward tiers above level 40.

**Errors.log** — 220 lines, but **all of them are the same two benign
data-validation complaints**, not runtime errors:
- Retail quests whose `RequiredSkillPoints` (210–450) exceed this profile's
  profession skill cap of 200 → "quest can't be done."
- Skill conditions referencing skill values above 200 → "skipped."

Both are AzerothCore noticing that stock retail content doesn't fit your reduced
caps. Expected, not a fault.

**Playerbots.log** — Normal operation (bots cycling through random-bot
updates). No errors.

## One thing worth noting

The **worldserver process is not currently running** — only `authserver` is
up. The Server.log ends cleanly (no crash, no shutdown error), so it looks like
it was stopped normally rather than dying. If you expected it to still be up,
that's the thing to look at — but it's not something the logs are flagging as
an error.

Every "error"-shaped line in these logs traces back to the vanilla profile's
level-40 / skill-200 caps meeting retail content built for level 80 / skill 450.
If you want, I can filter those out of the log at write time so `Errors.log`
only shows things that actually matter.

So *that's* the real event — the worldserver **segfaulted at startup**, right
after it finished initializing. Here's what I can and can't tell you.

## What happened

The server got all the way through init to `ready...`, then the **playerbots
world-thread processor** fired its first update tick (`AC>
PlayerbotWorldThreadProcessor initialized`) and crashed. The final lines in
`Playerbots.log` are the random-bot update loop iterating players (`Including
non-random bot player … into random bot update`) — so it died **inside
mod-playerbots' first bot-update pass**, not in core worldserver code. That's a
C++ segfault, not a Lua error.

## Why I can't name the exact line yet

Two things conspired to throw away the evidence:
- **No core dump** — `ulimit -c` is `0`, so the kernel wrote nothing even
  though `core_pattern` is set.
- **No backtrace** — this is a `RelWithDebInfo` build, and your launcher only
  auto-runs the crash catcher for `Debug` builds. It went straight to
  `./worldserver`, so nothing caught the fault.

So the logs tell us *where in the lifecycle* it died (playerbots first tick) but
not *which instruction*. Anyone who tells you the precise cause from these logs
alone is guessing.

## How to actually catch it

Your launcher already has the tool for this. gdb is installed (17.2), so re-run
with the catcher:

```bash
./scripts/worldserver --debug
```

That runs the same binary under gdb and, on the crash, dumps a full backtrace
(crashing thread + all threads) to:

```
tmp/debug-vanilla/worldserver-<timestamp>-backtrace.txt
```

Since it crashes seconds after `ready...`, you won't have to wait long. Send me
that file and I can point at the actual frame.

## One lead worth holding

There's an existing issue — *"Nil Bot Periodic Event Crash"* — describing
bots that enter the world-player list but aren't fully initialized when a
periodic pass touches them. Its documented fix (firing the ALE login hook for
bots) is marked **"needs application"** — i.e. possibly not actually built
into this binary. That's a *plausible* match for "crash on the first bot-update
tick," but it described a Lua nil error rather than a segfault, so I won't
commit to it until the backtrace confirms the frame.

Want me to check whether that playerbots login-hook patch is actually present in
the current `source-beta` tree / this build while you grab the backtrace?

this seems critical, can you look into it while I generate the debug logs?

Checked — the backtrace is conclusive. Here's the whole picture.

## What actually crashed

`SIGSEGV on Thread 1 (the main world thread)`, during the **first batch of
random-bot logins** (60 queued, **zero completed**):

```
#0 RacialsStrategy::InitTriggers   RacialsStrategy.cpp:30   Player* bot = botAI->GetBot();   ← fault
#1 Engine::Init                    Engine.cpp:129           strategy "racials"
#2 AiFactory::createCombatEngine   AiFactory.cpp:502
#3 PlayerbotAI::PlayerbotAI (ctor) PlayerbotAI.cpp:151
#4 PlayerbotsMgr::AddPlayerbotData PlayerbotMgr.cpp:1788    ← constructing a fresh AI
#5 PlayerbotHolder::OnBotLogin     PlayerbotMgr.cpp:481     ← holder = RandomPlayerbotMgr
#6 OnBotLoginOperation::Execute    PlayerbotOperations.h:511
#7 PlayerbotWorldThreadProcessor::ProcessBatch
```

It faults dereferencing `botAI` — a `Strategy` base-class back-pointer to the
owning `PlayerbotAI`. That pointer is pointing at freed/garbage memory.

## Ruling out the two suspects

**B002 / issue-306 (ALE login hook)** — not it. That was always a
*recoverable* Lua nil error, not a segfault. And it's genuinely fixed: the
`OnLogin` symbol and `MOD_ALE` wiring are compiled into the binary. Your
instinct that it "seemed critical" was reasonable, but it's a different bug.

**B026 (bot-login strategy guard)** — *this* is the patch that targets this
crash path, and it **is compiled into the binary** (I confirmed its log strings
are present). But it does **not** stop this crash, for two independent reasons:

1. **Its real fix never engages.** B026 fixes a *duplicate*-login race — a
   second `PlayerbotAI` built for a GUID that already had one. Its telltale
   warning `reclaiming stale AI (B026)` is **absent from both logs**, and **0
   bots logged in** before the crash. This dies on the *first* login of the
   *first* bot. Different trigger.
2. **Its defensive guard is at the wrong dereference.** B026 inserts `if
   (!strategy) continue;` before `strategy->GetType()` at Engine.cpp:126. But
   (a) the fault is three lines later at `strategy->InitTriggers()` (line 129),
   and (b) the strategy pointer is **non-null** (`0x…fc40`) — it's the
   strategy's *internal* `botAI` that's dangling. A null check can't catch a
   use-after-free.

## The real root cause

Strategies aren't built fresh in the engine — they're pulled from the bot's
`aiObjectContext` via `GetStrategy(name)` (Engine.cpp:355), and each is `new
RacialsStrategy(botAI)` where `botAI` comes from **the context**
(StrategyContext.h:150). The engine in frame #2 is initialized from an
`aiObjectContext` whose `botAI` points at a **destroyed** `PlayerbotAI`. Every
strategy it lazily creates inherits that dangling pointer; `Engine::Init` then
faults at **the first strategy whose `InitTriggers` immediately dereferences
`botAI`** — which, in `std::map` order, is `racials` (the earlier ones —
boost, chat, default… — have trivial or non-dereferencing trigger init, so
they slid past).

This is the *same "dangling strategy owned by a dead context"* family B026 named
— but reached through a path B026's `AddPlayerbotData` dedup doesn't cover (no
duplicate, so its delete-before-reconstruct never runs). So either the context
is being reused from an earlier torn-down AI for this bot via an uncovered
route, or the context's `botAI` isn't repointed to the live facade before
strategies are pulled. Pinning which needs a read of the `PlayerbotAI` ctor +
how `aiObjectContext` is obtained — one more layer down.

This is a **mod-playerbots bug on this branch** (rev `52f58186a533`, Playerbot
branch, 2026-07-10), not something our patches introduced — they just don't
yet cover it.

## Where I'd go next — your call

1. **Immediate unblock (operational):** these are `RandomPlayerbotMgr`
   auto-logins, so the server can't finish boot while they fire. Turning down
   the startup burst (`AiPlayerbot.RandomBotAutologin = 0`, or a low
   `RandomBotMinLevel`/count) in `playerbots.conf` should let the world come up
   while we fix the real bug. Fastest path to a running server.
2. **Real fix (new patch, e.g. B027):** ensure the `aiObjectContext`'s `botAI`
   is the live facade before the engine initializes strategies — i.e. don't
   let a first-login engine build off a stale context. I'd write an issue file
   first (this is a feature-grade fix, not a one-line bugfix), then extend the
   patch set. I'll need to read `PlayerbotAI.cpp:151` and the context-creation
   path to target it precisely.
3. **Bisect upstream:** if this started recently, a playerbots commit around
   2026-07-10 regressed context/AI lifetime on the login path; pinning to the
   prior known-good commit sidesteps it until upstream fixes it.

Want me to start with #1 to get you a bootable server, then open an issue and
dig into #2? I haven't changed anything yet.

The ownership is actually **per-bot and should be safe**: `AiObjectContext`
holds a per-instance `strategyContexts` with its own cache, created fresh with
the live facade at `PlayerbotAI.cpp:149`. So a naive "set botAI = facade" fix
would be a no-op — the defect is subtler (a stale/torn-down facade reaching
this path, exactly B026's family but not via the dedup it guards).

That reshapes the right fix: a **guard + diagnostic at the actual faulting
site** — in `Engine::Init`, before `InitTriggers`, verify each strategy's
stored `botAI` matches the engine's live facade; skip-and-log on mismatch
instead of segfaulting. That both keeps the server up *and* tells us the exact
nature of the bad pointer on recurrence (which decides whether option 3 is
needed). Let me nail the exact accessors before writing, and read the
patch-system skill.

## Principle: machinery, not procedure

A **procedure** is a sequence an operator (human or LLM) must work through by
hand. A **machine** is a set of components wired together so the outcome falls
out
deterministically, with no operator memory in the loop. This system is built
entirely as machinery, on purpose:

- **Every "remember to…" is a defect.** Anything that depends on the operator
  recalling a step is a latent bug. Convert it into one of four mechanical
  forms:
  a **guard** (a precondition check that makes the operation a no-op when it
  shouldn't fire), a **trap** (cleanup wired to process exit so it runs even on
  failure), a **generated artifact** (a derived file that can't drift because
  it's
  recomputed, never hand-edited), or a **gate** (a hard stop that refuses to
  proceed until an explicit condition or approval is satisfied).

- **The only inputs left to a human are irreducible.** Three, specifically: the
  *transformation itself* (the old→new text edit and the anchor that locates
  it),
  the *judgment that a given patch belongs upstream*, and the *approval of an
  outward-facing action* (opening a PR, deleting a fork). Everything else —
  when
  patches apply, when they revert, whether they still match, what the registry
  says, whether the tree is clean — is wired and deterministic.

Read every section below as "here is a component and how it is wired so the
guarantee holds without anyone watching," not "here are steps to perform."

---

## The core problem this solves

You depend on a third-party codebase — an upstream project, a vendored
library, a
submodule. You need to change it: fix a build error against your toolchain, add
a
hook, silence warnings, tune a constant, adjust a behavior. The two naive
approaches both rot:

- **Edit the source in place.** Edits get clobbered when you pull upstream, or
  they silently survive and are forgotten. The tree drifts and nobody can tell
  your changes from upstream's.
- **Maintain a hard fork.** Every upstream update is a merge conflict. The fork
  diverges, the diff grows opaque, and "what did we change and why" becomes
  unanswerable.

The machine takes a third path: **the cloned source tree is a disposable build
artifact.** It is never committed and never the source of truth. The source of
truth is a directory of small scripts, each of which knows how to *apply* one
customization and how to *reverse* it. On every build the machine stamps the
changes into a freshly-cloned tree and peels them back off afterward; the tree
round-trips to a pristine copy of upstream HEAD.

What you version is the **intent** (the apply/unapply scripts and their
headers),
not the **result** (the modified source). The result is a deterministic function
of `upstream + scripts`, regenerated on demand.

## What the machinery buys you

- **Upstream updates stop hurting.** Re-clone, re-apply. A patch that no longer
  matches fails loudly with an unmatched pattern — a *signal* the machine
  surfaces
  automatically, pointing at the one patch to re-target, rather than a conflict
  to
  resolve across the tree.
- **Every change is documented at the point of change.** Each script's header
  records the upstream symptom, the pattern it matches, and how it reverses —
  and
  the registry is *generated* from those headers, so "what did we change and
  why"
  is always answerable and never stale.
- **The diff is legible.** N upstream problems become N small, named, anchored
  edits, not one sprawling fork diff.
- **Changes are portable.** A patch script (or its prose "patch doc") replays
  onto
  any compatible upstream. You ship knowledge, not binaries.

---

## Mental model: a patch is a reversible function over a text tree

Each patch is a **pair of functions** over the source tree:

```
apply:    pristine_tree    ->  customized_tree
unapply:  customized_tree  ->  pristine_tree     (exact inverse of apply)
```

Two properties, both enforced mechanically rather than by discipline:

1. **Idempotent.** `apply` twice equals `apply` once; same for `unapply`. The
   enforcement is a *guard*: apply checks "is the un-patched pattern present?"
   before editing; unapply checks "is the post-patch shape present?" before
   reverting. An already-applied patch is a silent no-op — not because the
   operator avoided re-running it, but because the guard makes re-running inert.

2. **Exact-inverse.** `unapply(apply(tree)) == tree`. The unapply transformation
   is the literal mirror of the apply transformation. This is what lets the tree
   round-trip — and it is *asserted* by the verify harness (below), not
   trusted.

---

## The tiers: components separated by *when they fire* and *what they target*

Customizations fire at different moments and touch different trees, so the
machine
groups them into tiers keyed to the **chronological phase of the build**. Each
tier is a driver function; a project wires up as many as its chronology requires
(often fewer than three).

```
PRE-BUILD   (source patches)    before compile   edits the SOURCE tree (code you don't own)
POST-BUILD  (install patches)   after install    sets up the INSTALL tree (configs, assets, schema)
POST-DEPLOY (config patches)    after promote     tunes the LIVE config (paths, secrets, runtime knobs)
```

| Tier | Fires | Target | Job | Reverts? |
|------|-------|--------|-----|----------|
| **PRE-BUILD** | after clone, before compile | upstream source files | make upstream build/behave for you (fixes, hooks, warning silencing, behavior tweaks) | **Yes** — must revert so the source stays pristine |
| **POST-BUILD** | after install-to-staging, before validate | the just-installed staging tree (configs from templates, log dirs, symlinks, schema/data) | set up a freshly-installed instance | usually no (re-run is idempotent) |
| **POST-DEPLOY** | after promoting staging to live, before start | live config files + runtime data rows | write deploy-specific values unknowable earlier: which database, which paths, which ports, plus runtime tuning | no |

**The separation is chronological because each tier has a precondition the prior
phase establishes.** PRE-BUILD needs the source present but the binary not yet
built. POST-BUILD needs the binary installed into staging, though the live
directory may not exist. POST-DEPLOY needs the live directory to exist (promote
created it) so it can write paths/credentials pointing *at* it — values that
did
not exist at any earlier phase. The tiers cannot be collapsed without violating
a
precondition. A side benefit of wiring runtime-tuning (POST-DEPLOY) *after* the
validation gate: a botched tuning value cannot fail validation, because
validation
runs against complete, valid staging configs from POST-BUILD; POST-DEPLOY writes
only the *delta* between "valid for staging" and "valid for live."

**PRE-BUILD is the load-bearing tier** — the only one touching code you don't
own,
hence the only one whose revert must be exact. POST-BUILD and POST-DEPLOY touch
*your* artifacts and behave like ordinary idempotent setup. Wire only the tiers
your chronology demands.

The load-bearing line of the whole design lives in `.gitignore`:

```gitignore
source/
```

The cloned source is **never tracked**. A surviving modification to upstream
code
in your repo's history is, by construction, a bug — a failed unapply or a
manual
edit that should have been a patch. (The verify harness and a clean-tree
assertion
catch both before they land.)

---

## The build driver: a wired pipeline, not a list of steps

The build is a composition of functions in which **each edge guarantees the
precondition the next stage relies on.** Nobody "performs the steps"; the driver
runs the graph and the invariants hold by construction. The wiring, in full:

```bash
source patches/patches.sh

reset_source_trees                       # ⟶ guarantees: source == upstream HEAD
audit_patches "$(cat .upstream-lock)" \
              "$(git -C "$SRC" rev-parse HEAD)"   # ⟶ on update: classify/flag drift
apply_patches_prebuild                   # ⟶ guarantees: customizations present
trap 'unapply_patches_prebuild' EXIT     # ⟶ guarantees: revert happens NO MATTER WHAT
build                                    # compile the customized tree
install_to_staging                       # binaries land in staging, not live
apply_patches_install                    # ⟶ guarantees: staging is set up
trap - EXIT                              # success path: disarm the net...
unapply_patches_prebuild                 # ...and revert explicitly ⟶ source pristine
git -C "$SRC" rev-parse HEAD > .upstream-lock   # ⟶ baseline advances ONLY on success
```

Each wire, and the guarantee it makes deterministic:

- **`reset_source_trees` first, unconditionally.** Hard-resets the clone and
  every
  submodule to HEAD. On a clean tree it is a no-op; on a dirty tree it discards
  residue from a build killed in a way that bypassed the trap (SIGKILL, OOM,
  power
  loss). Running it always — never "only if dirty" — is what makes "source
  ==
  HEAD" a *guaranteed* entry precondition rather than a hope. It is the backstop
  for the one failure the trap cannot catch: a signal that kills the shell
  outright.

  ```bash
  reset_source_trees() {
      git -C "${SRC}" reset --hard HEAD --quiet
      for sub in "${SRC}"/<submodules>/*/; do
          [[ -d "${sub}/.git" ]] && git -C "${sub}" reset --hard HEAD --quiet
      done
  }
  ```

- **The trap is the revert machine.** `trap 'unapply_patches_prebuild' EXIT`
  wires
  the revert to process exit, so a crashed or failed build leaves the source
  clean
  anyway. The explicit `unapply` on the success path (after disarming) is the
  normal route; the trap covers every abnormal one. Together they make "the tree
  returns to HEAD" true across *all* exit modes, with no operator action.

- **`.upstream-lock` advances only after success.** Wiring the lock write to the
  end of the successful path means the audit's baseline can never point at a
  version you didn't actually ship. A failed build leaves the previous baseline
  intact.

The driver loads the active profile's patch list and dispatches by naming
convention — no central registry of "which function to call," just a glob and
a
grep over declared functions:

```bash
apply_patches_prebuild() {
    local patches="${PREBUILD_PATCHES[$PROFILE]:-}"
    for patch_id in ${patches}; do                  # e.g. "P001 P004 P009"
        local fn=$(declare -F | grep "^declare -f patch_${patch_id}_" | sed 's/declare -f //')
        [[ -n "${fn}" ]] && ${fn}
    done
}
```

`redownload-source` is the regeneration lever: it removes only the source tree
(leaving build dirs, installed artifacts, data, config untouched), so "the
source
is in a weird state" is never a debugging session — it's `redownload-source &&
install`. That shortcut is *safe specifically because* the real work lives in
`patches/`, not in the tree.

---

## Anatomy of a patch (the standard component)

Every patch file is a self-contained apply/unapply pair with a header. The
header
fields are not prose decoration — they are the input the generator emits and
the
data the registry generator and audit machine read back. Canonical shape:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# P017-<short-name>.sh
#
# TARGET:   <relative/path/to/file> :: <function or region>
# SYMPTOM:  <what upstream does / the code as shipped>
# CHANGE:   <what we make it do, and WHY>
# ANCHOR:   <the unique pattern the apply keys on>
# WITNESS:  <a string present ONLY in the patched form>
# MATCHES:  1            # expected match count of ANCHOR (verify asserts this)

# {{{ patch_P017_<short_name>
patch_P017_<short_name>() {
    local FILE="${SRC}/<relative/path/to/file>"
    [[ -f "${FILE}" ]] || return 0                 # missing target = silent skip

    # Marker-wrapped replacement: the NEW block carries unique markers so the
    # inverse can locate it EXACTLY and can never false-match upstream or a
    # sibling patch, no matter how upstream reflows around it.
    sed -i -z 's|<OLD upstream text, escaped>|<C> {{{ P017-marker\n<NEW text>\n<C> }}} P017-marker|' "${FILE}"
}
# }}}

# {{{ unpatch_P017_<short_name>
unpatch_P017_<short_name>() {
    local FILE="${SRC}/<relative/path/to/file>"
    [[ -f "${FILE}" ]] || return 0
    # Exact inverse: match the marker-wrapped NEW block, restore OLD.
    sed -i -z 's|<C> {{{ P017-marker\n<NEW text escaped>\n<C> }}} P017-marker|<OLD upstream text>|' "${FILE}"
}
# }}}

# {{{ patch_needs_applying_P017   (the witness probe)
patch_needs_applying_P017() {
    local FILE="${SRC}/<relative/path/to/file>"
    [[ -f "${FILE}" ]] && ! grep -q "P017-marker" "${FILE}"   # absent witness ⟶ needs applying
}
# }}}
```

(`<C>` is the target language's line-comment token — `//`, `#`, `--`, `;`,
…)

The mechanical properties the *shape* enforces:

- **The guard makes idempotency structural.** A one-line edit guards with
  `grep -q "<unpatched anchor>" && sed …`; run it again and the anchor is
  gone, so
  nothing happens. The operator never has to track "did I already apply this."
- **Anchored, one-to-one patterns.** N problems = N anchored edits + N inverses.
  A
  broad pattern corrupts clean source; the `MATCHES` field plus the verify
  harness
  turn "anchor tightly" from advice into an asserted invariant.
- **Markers make the inverse robust.** A unique `{{{ <ID> … }}} <ID>` wrapper
  is a
  stable handle the inverse always finds and a sibling patch can never hit. The
  same marker doubles as the witness, so the probe and the inverse agree by
  construction.
- **The witness probe is the deterministic answer to "is this needed?"** —
  reused
  by the build's skip shortcut, by `--dry-run`, and by the audit's convergence
  test.

## The generator and the verifier replace the "add a patch" checklist

Adding a patch is not a remembered procedure; it is **a generator that stamps
the
component and a verifier that refuses malformed ones.** The only human input is
the irreducible creative part — the actual old→new edit and its anchor.

- **`scaffold-patch <tier> <name> <file>`** computes the next free ID for the
  tier
  (by scanning existing filenames), emits the skeleton above with the header
  fields and the `patch_/unpatch_/needs_applying_` triplet pre-named, and
  pre-fills
  the marker string. The author fills in only the `sed` bodies and the
  OLD/NEW/ANCHOR/WITNESS fields.
- **`verify-patches`** is the assertion harness, wired into the build and CI as
  a
  gate. For each patch it mechanically checks, against a fresh clone:
  - apply changes the tree;
  - `grep -c "<ANCHOR>"` equals the declared `MATCHES` (0 or >1 ⟶ fail);
  - the witness is present after apply and absent after unapply;
  - **the round-trip is exact**: `apply → unapply → git diff` is empty.
  A patch that fails any assertion never enters the active set — the property
  isn't "the author tested it," it's "the harness won't let a broken one build."
- **`gen-registry`** regenerates `docs/patches/patch-registry.md` by reading the
  header fields of every patch file. The registry is a *generated artifact*: it
  cannot drift from reality because it is never hand-edited, only recomputed.
  "Add
  a row to the registry" — a classic forgettable step — ceases to exist as a
  manual act.

---

## The orchestrator (`patches.sh`): wiring, not bookkeeping

One sourced file wires the components together:

1. **Auto-registration by glob.** Each patch file, when sourced, registers its
   functions; the orchestrator just globs them in. Adding a file *is*
   registering
   it — there is no separate manifest to keep in sync.
   ```bash
   PATCHES_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
   for f in "${PATCHES_DIR}"/P[0-9][0-9][0-9]-*.sh; do [[ -f "$f" ]] && source "$f"; done
   ```

2. **Per-profile selection as declarative structure.** The one genuinely
   *declarative* input — which patches a build variant wants — lives as an
   associative array (configuration in structure, greppable, with inline
   justification). This is the human's intent encoded as data the drivers read;
   it
   is config, not procedure.
   ```bash
   declare -A PREBUILD_PATCHES=(
       ["minimal"]="P001 P004"
       ["standard"]="P001 P004 P009 ... P024"   # compile fixes + module compat
       ["full"]="P001 P002 P003 ... P024"       # everything incl. feature hooks
   )
   ```

3. **The drivers** (`apply_*`, `unapply_*`, `reset_source_trees`,
   `patches_need_applying`, `audit_patches`) each iterate the active profile's
   list
   and dispatch by naming convention. Dispatch-by-convention means there is no
   lookup table to maintain — the function name *is* the registration.

**Revert reporting is computed, not narrated.** `unapply_patches_prebuild`
snapshots `git status --porcelain` across the tree and submodules before and
after
each unpatch and prints `[<ID>] Reverted` only when content actually changed.
"Nothing printed" is therefore an unambiguous, machine-derived fact (with a
no-op
count in the summary), not an operator guess.

---

## Profiles: one parts bin, many machines

A **profile** is a named selection of patches (and submodules, and config
values).
The same `patches/` directory drives every variant; the per-profile arrays
select
the subset. The active profile is itself read mechanically — from a `.profile`
file, overridable by `--profile` — so the selection is data the machine
consumes,
never a flag an operator must remember to pass:

```bash
PROFILE="$([[ -f "${ROOT}/.profile" ]] && cat "${ROOT}/.profile" || echo "standard")"
```

The **a/b variant pattern** encodes "same setting, different value per profile"
as
two sibling patches with non-overlapping profile lists, so exactly one fires.
History stays visible — old values are recorded as siblings, not overwritten
—
which is itself a small machine for never losing the prior decision.

---

## De-patching: three cleanup mechanisms, each wired to its own trigger

There is no "decide which cleanup to run." There are three mechanisms, and the
**call site selects the right one automatically**:

| Mechanism | Wired to (trigger) | Guarantee it provides |
|-----------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| `unapply_patches_prebuild` | the EXIT trap, and the success-path revert | reverses exactly the patches *this run* applied, with computed per-patch reporting |
| `reset_source_trees` | the unconditional pre-flight at every build entry point | drives the tree to a known commit; cannot fabricate dirt |
| `apply-patches --revert` | the operator surface (manual) | exposes revert by hand; for source patches it also triggers an incremental rebuild so the binary matches |

The split exists because of a real failure mode that makes one mechanism unsafe
in
the other's role:

> An `unapply` transformation targets *the post-patch shape*. It cannot
> distinguish
> "we applied this" from "upstream now ships this." When upstream converges on
> the
> form you patched to, a defensive unapply silently reverts **clean upstream
> code
> into false dirt.**

So the wiring assigns each mechanism the job it is safe for: `unapply` only ever
runs to reverse patches the same run applied (where authorship is certain), and
`reset_source_trees` — which goes to a commit and *cannot* manufacture dirt
— is
the one wired to every defensive/pre-flight position. The operator never
chooses;
the call site already did.

The operator surface itself is the one deliberately human-facing tool:

```
./scripts/apply-patches --dry-run            # show which patches WOULD apply (computed)
./scripts/apply-patches --prebuild           # apply source patches to the tree
./scripts/apply-patches --prebuild --revert  # revert + incremental rebuild
./scripts/apply-patches --profile minimal --prebuild
```

It is a thin, explicit control panel over the same drivers — not a procedure,
a
switchboard.

---

## The pruning machine: auditing patches on every upstream update

Patches rot as upstream moves: some become redundant (upstream fixed it), some
stale (upstream restructured the target), some quietly mean something different
(upstream changed the region around your anchor). The pruning machine makes "are
these still needed?" a **computed verdict wired into the update path** — not a
review someone must remember to run. It is invoked by the build driver on every
update (`audit_patches OLD NEW`), so it *cannot be skipped*.

## What it computes, per patch, against the pristine new tree

The machine reads each patch's `TARGET`, `ANCHOR`, and `WITNESS` header fields
and
emits exactly one verdict:

1. **RETIRE (convergence).** The witness probe reports the patch is no longer
   needed on pristine upstream → upstream adopted your shape. The edit is
   redundant.
2. **STALE (disappearance).** The anchor is absent from the target → upstream
   restructured the code out from under the patch; apply can no longer match.
3. **REVIEW (collision).** Upstream's changed line ranges overlap the patch's
   anchor line → the patch may still apply but its meaning in the new context
   is no
   longer guaranteed.
4. **OK.** Anchor intact, region untouched.

The collision test is computed directly from the version-control delta — hunk
headers give the changed line ranges in the new revision:

```bash
# Lines changed in <file> between old and new upstream. --unified=0 makes each
# hunk header report exactly the changed range: @@ -<oS>,<oL> +<nStart>,<nLen> @@
git -C "${SRC}" diff --unified=0 "${OLD_REF}" "${NEW_REF}" -- "${file}" \
  | awk '/^@@/ { split(,a,","); s=substr(a[1],2)+0; l=(a[2]==""?1:a[2])+0;
                 if (l>0) print s","(s+l-1) }'
```

The patch's anchor line is `grep -n "<ANCHOR>" "${file}" | head -1 | cut -d:
-f1`;
overlap with any printed range (optionally padded by context) is the trigger.

## The machine emits its own worklist — and a durable record

For every REVIEW and STALE verdict, the audit **auto-inserts a uniquely-tagged
comment** into the working tree directly above the anchor, in the file's own
comment syntax:

```bash
insert_audit_tag() {                       # <file> <line> <patch_id> <range>
    local C; C="$(comment_token_for "")" # //, #, --, ; … by extension
    sed -i "${2}i\\${C} [[PATCH-AUDIT  ]] upstream changed this region — \
confirm patch still needed and the anchor still matches, then delete this line." ""
}
```

Now a single `grep -rn "PATCH-AUDIT" "${SRC}"` *enumerates the entire decision
set*
mechanically — the machine produces the worklist; the human (or LLM) supplies
only
the irreducible judgment per site, then deletes the tag. Two records, two
lifetimes, both produced automatically:

- **In-tree tags are ephemeral** — they live in the disposable tree and vanish
  at
  the next `reset_source_trees`, which is exactly right for one review session.
- **A persistent report** (`docs/patches/audit-<NEW_REF>.md`) records every
  verdict, so the decision history survives the reset.

## The gate

Whether the audit *blocks* or merely *warns* is a wired policy, not a habit:
block
in CI/releases (a stale patch is a latent bug), warn in fast local iteration.
The
`.upstream-lock` baseline advances only on a successful build, so the next audit
always compares against the last *known-good* version — the machine cannot
drift
its own reference point.

---

## Patch docs: the prose form (a portable replay artifact)

For complex multi-file changes, a **prose "patch doc"** in
`docs/patches/<feature>.md`
describes the edit in human/agent-readable form — file paths, insertion points
by
*context* (not just line number), before/after snippets — so any agent or
human
can **replay it onto any compatible upstream** even after line numbers drift. It
is
the durable, forge-independent specification a script (or a reviewer)
implements.

```markdown
# <Feature> Patch
## Overview        — what this adds and why
## Files to Modify — for each file: context to locate the spot + the change
## Build           — how to rebuild after applying
```

The three artifacts form a ladder: a **behavior spec** says what the system
should
do (portable across reimplementations); a **patch doc** says what edits to make
to
one codebase (portable across upstreams of it); a **patch script** is the
mechanical, idempotent, reversible implementation. Each is derivable downward.

---

## Contributing a patch upstream: the same machine, run forward-only

A subset of your patches are genuine upstream improvements. For those, the
system
is already most of a contribution machine: the build runs `apply → build →
unapply`; a contribution runs `apply → commit`. **Same apply function,
different
downstream wiring.** A patch's anchored transformation against a pristine clone
of
upstream HEAD *produces the contribution diff*; the header *is* the PR body.

This is built as a driver with **gates** at the outward-facing edges — the one
place where the machine deliberately halts and requires irreducible human input.

## The two human inputs the machine is built around

- **Eligibility is a human judgment, never automated.** Only the author knows
  whether an edit belongs upstream. The machine therefore records no
  upstreamability field and decides nothing; it acts only on a patch a human
  hands
  it. (A behavior change worth upstreaming should be contributed behind a config
  flag, with the patch-doc as the PR body.)
- **Each outward action is gated on approval.** Fork creation, branch push, PR
  open, and optional fork deletion each pass through a gate that renders what
  will
  happen and refuses to proceed without an explicit yes.

Everything *between* those two human touch-points is wired and deterministic:

## Forge detection — computed from the remote, not asked

```bash
remote_url="$(git -C "${SRC}" remote get-url upstream 2>/dev/null \
            || git -C "${SRC}" remote get-url origin)"
case "${remote_url}" in
    *github.com*) FORGE=gh   ;;   # gh pr create
    *gitlab*)     FORGE=glab ;;   # glab mr create
    *gitea*|*)    FORGE=tea  ;;   # gitea: tea pr create / REST API
esac
# owner/repo derive from the same URL; an unrecognized host trips a gate (ask).
```

## Fork and clone are different objects with different lifetimes

The machine keeps these roles mechanically distinct, which is what lets a
persistent fork coexist with a throwaway tmpfs clone:

- **The fork is server-side and durable.** Created once on the account, it holds
  the PR branches and survives so review threads persist. It is **not** on
  tmpfs.
- **The working clone is local and disposable, and exactly one is needed** for
  any
  number of open PRs. Per patch, the machine resets the clone to pristine
  default-branch HEAD (reusing `reset_source_trees`), cuts `patch/<id>-<name>`,
  applies that one patch forward-only, commits, and pushes the branch to the
  fork.
  The fork accumulates one branch per PR; the clone is recycled between them.
- **Each PR carries only its relevant files, by construction** — because each
  patch is atomic and one-to-one targeted, its branch differs from base only in
  the
  files it touches. No filtering machinery is needed.
- **Open PRs survive clone deletion**: once a branch is pushed, its commits live
  on
  the remote fork, so end-of-run cleanup (`rm` the clone) cannot disturb them.

## Clone placement — a measured decision, with a logged fallback

The clone prefers the RAM-backed `tmp/` symlink and falls to on-disk only when
it
won't fit. The fit test measures **space available on that mount right now**
(not
total capacity — other things already occupy it):

```bash
avail=$(df -kP "${ROOT}/tmp" | awk 'NR==2 {print  * 1024}')   # free bytes NOW
need=$(( $(forge_repo_size_kb) * 1024 * 2 ))                    # shallow clone + margin
if (( avail >= need )); then
    CLONE_DIR="${ROOT}/tmp/pr-work"
else
    CLONE_DIR="${ROOT}/.pr-work"        # on-disk fallback inside the project
    echo "FALLBACK: tmp/ has ${avail} B free; clone needs ~${need} B. Using" \
         "on-disk ${CLONE_DIR}. This is a fallback, not the normal path." >&2
fi
git clone --depth 1 --branch "<default-branch>" "<fork-url>" "${CLONE_DIR}"
```

The fallback announces itself every time it fires — a silent fallback would
hide a
capacity problem worth surfacing. Either location is `rm`'d when the run ends.

## The verify-match interlock

Before any gate is reached, the machine asserts each patch's anchored pattern
hits
its declared `MATCHES` count on upstream HEAD. A zero or extra match means the
patch was written against an older ref and **the driver aborts** rather than
opening a PR on stale assumptions — the same signal the pruning machine uses,
reused here as a pre-flight interlock.

## The driver, as a graph

```
select(patch)            ─ human: hands the machine an eligible patch
detect_forge(remote)     ─ computed
ensure_fork()            ─ GATE: approve creating the server-side fork (once)
place_clone()            ─ tmpfs if it fits now, else on-disk fallback (logged)
for each patch:
    reset → branch → apply(forward-only) → verify_match()   ─ abort on mismatch
    render(diff, pr_body_from_header)                       ─ computed
    GATE: approve push + PR open
    push_branch(); open_pr(FORGE)
cleanup()                ─ rm the clone; fork + open PRs remain
```

The driver *prepares* everything up to each gate and stops; nothing reaches the
network or the account without the human passing that gate.

---

## Non-textual patches (same discipline, different substrate)

The apply/unapply/idempotent/round-trip machinery is not specific to text:

- **A data row** (registering a path with an upstream's own migration/plugin
  runner): apply is an idempotent insert (`INSERT IGNORE`, or
  create-if-not-exists
  keyed on a unique column); unapply is the matching delete; the guard checks
  for
  the row.
- **A binary asset or generated file**: apply writes/links it, unapply removes
  it,
  the guard checks presence.

**Where upstream provides its own seam — a plugin dir, a migrations folder, a
hooks
directory — wire into it instead of editing upstream files.** A registration
is a
patch that *cannot* conflict, because you are using a mechanism upstream
intends.

## Assembling the machine in a new project

This is a parts list and wiring diagram, not a sequence to march through. Build
the
components; the guarantees emerge from how they connect.

- **Disposability wire:** add `source/` (or `vendor/`, or the submodule path) to
  `.gitignore`. Commit only `patches/` and `scripts/`. This single line is what
  makes the tree a regenerable artifact rather than a thing to protect.
- **The orchestrator (`patches.sh`):** glob-source patch files; declare the
  per-profile `declare -A` lists; define `reset_source_trees`, the
  `apply_/unapply_`
  drivers, and `audit_patches`. Dispatch by naming convention so there is no
  manifest to maintain.
- **The standard component:** patches as guarded, anchored, marker-wrapped,
  exact-inverse pairs with a witness probe and header fields. The substrate (any
  language, any config DSL) is irrelevant — anchored `sed`/`awk` operate on
  any
  text tree; non-textual patches swap the tool and keep the contract.
- **The generators and the gate:** `scaffold-patch` (emits components),
  `gen-registry` (recomputes the registry from headers), `verify-patches`
  (asserts
  round-trip + match-count and blocks the build on failure).
- **The build driver:** compose `reset → audit → apply → (trap) → build
  → install →
  unapply → record-lock` exactly as the wiring above, so every precondition is
  a
  guaranteed product of the prior edge.
- **The pruning machine + lock:** `audit_patches` wired into the update path,
  `.upstream-lock` written only on success.
- **The contribution driver (optional):** forward-only apply against a fork
  clone,
  forge detection from the remote, verify-match interlock, and approval gates at
  the outward edges.

Tiers beyond PRE-BUILD are added only when the chronology demands them.

## Failure modes the machinery is built to foreclose

These are not reminders for an operator — they are the specific failures each
mechanism above exists to make impossible. Stated as "the bug, and the part that
forecloses it":

- **False dirt from defensive unapply.** `unapply` matches the post-patch shape
  and
  cannot tell your edit from an upstream that converged on it; run defensively
  it
  reverts clean code into phantom diffs that read like upstream regressions.
  *Foreclosed by* wiring `unapply` only to same-run reverts and
  `reset_source_trees`
  (which goes to a commit) to every defensive position — the call site, not
  the
  operator, picks the safe one.
- **Silent corruption from a loose pattern.** An unanchored pattern matching two
  sites edits the wrong one. *Foreclosed by* the `MATCHES` field +
  `verify-patches`,
  which fail any patch whose anchor count isn't exactly as declared.
- **A fragile inverse.** Reverting by re-matching content breaks when upstream
  reflows around the block. *Foreclosed by* the unique `{{{ <ID> }}}` markers,
  which give the inverse a stable handle and double as the witness.
- **Double-apply / double-revert.** Retries, re-sourcing, and trap-over-explicit
  all run things twice. *Foreclosed by* the guards that make a repeated apply or
  unapply inert.
- **A patch that applies but won't reverse.** It leaks false dirt into the
  *next*
  build, far from its origin. *Foreclosed by* the round-trip assertion in
  `verify-patches` (`apply → unapply → empty diff`), which blocks it from
  the set.
- **Residue from an uncatchable kill.** The EXIT trap misses SIGKILL/OOM/power
  loss. *Foreclosed by* the unconditional pre-flight `reset_source_trees`, which
  covers exactly the modes the trap cannot.
- **A re-targeting need going unnoticed.** Upstream moves the code under a
  patch.
  *Foreclosed by* a loud unmatched-pattern failure and the pruning machine's
  STALE/REVIEW verdicts with auto-inserted tags — the machine surfaces the one
  patch needing attention instead of letting it drift.
- **The patch set silently rotting.** *Foreclosed by* wiring `audit_patches`
  into
  the update path so it cannot be skipped, and generating the registry from
  headers
  so it cannot go stale.
- **A poisoned audit baseline.** *Foreclosed by* writing `.upstream-lock` only
  on a
  successful build, so the machine never compares against a version it didn't
  ship.
- **A tuning knob masquerading as a build failure.** *Foreclosed by* the
  chronology: POST-DEPLOY writes runtime values only after the validation gate.
- **A tracked or surviving source edit.** It breaks the `upstream + patches`
  guarantee. *Foreclosed by* the `.gitignore` wire plus a clean-tree assertion
  —
  any surviving edit is a verify failure, not a thing to remember not to do.
- **An outward action firing without consent.** *Foreclosed by* the approval
  gates
  on fork/push/PR/delete, which render the action and refuse to proceed without
  an
  explicit yes.

Next free Phase-3 ID is **308**. Let me read the `patches.sh` structure — how

Everything checks out. Both target files are pristine (my anchor analysis was
sound); the 24 dirty files are harmless last-build residue in the disposable
module tree that `reset_source_trees` wipes at the next build.

## Option 2 is built and verified — ready for your compile

**What I created** (nothing committed; source tree untouched):
- `issues/308-playerbot-engine-init-stale-facade-crash.md` — the
  behavior/root-cause spec
- `docs/patches/playerbot-engine-init-facade-guard.md` — the exact code
  changes
- `patches/B027-playerbots-engine-init-facade-guard.sh` — the reversible patch
- `patches/patches.sh` — B027 added to release/beta/vanilla lists +
  `needs_applying` helper

**What B027 does.** `Engine` and every `Strategy` both store a `PlayerbotAI*`
facade. The engine is built for one bot with the *live, under-construction*
facade — which is provably valid — so a strategy whose facade differs is
stale/foreign, and that mismatch is the **only** way the `botAI->GetBot()`
dereference can fault. B027 adds a public `GetAI()` accessor to
`PlayerbotAIAware`, then in `Engine::Init` skips + logs any strategy whose
facade ≠ the engine's, right before the two facade-using calls
(`InitMultipliers`/`InitTriggers`). A hard segfault becomes a named log line,
and the login burst completes.

**Verification I ran** (non-destructive, in `/tmp`):
- Both anchors match **exactly once** (no silent no-op — the B002 failure
  mode)
- **Idempotent** (apply×2 = one block each)
- **Exact round-trip** (unapply restores both files byte-identical)
- **Composes with B026** in both apply orders — the two guards coexist,
  `Engine.cpp` round-trips clean either way

**Build it when ready** (you run the compile):
```bash
./scripts/compile          # or ./scripts/azerothcore update
```
Then start worldserver.

**How to read the outcome — this is the branch point to option 3:**
- **Boots, no crash, no B027 log lines** → clean fix; issue 308 resolvable.
- **Boots, *with* `Engine::Init: strategy <name> carries a stale or foreign bot
  facade` lines** → fixed *and* it just told us the mechanism (which strategy,
  how often). Send me those lines; they confirm whether the stale facade is
  worth a deeper upstream fix.
- **Still crashes** (guard never fired) → the fault isn't a facade mismatch,
  so we go to **option 3**: pin mod-playerbots (`52f58186a533`, 2026-07-10) to a
  prior known-good commit. The debug-run harness (`./scripts/worldserver
  --debug`) will give a fresh backtrace to confirm.

One small housekeeping note: your convention says new docs get added to
`docs/table-of-contents.md`. I left that alone since the existing
`docs/patches/*` don't appear to be indexed there — say the word if you want
it added.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### User Request 8

alright the server is compiled and the worldserver is running. It hasn't
finished booting yet - can you examine the compile logs, then set a short timer
if the worldserver isn't done yet, to re-examine the boot logs and move forward?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Assistant Response 8

**B027 is confirmed live in the running binary** — the exact guard log string
(`Engine::Init: strategy {} carries a stale or foreign bot facade … (B027,
issue 308)`) is compiled in, and the binary is freshly built (17:39:55 today).
So the guard will fire if a stale-faced strategy shows up.

**Current state:** worldserver (PID 16251) is mid-boot at "Loading TalentSpecs"
— early in the ~41s playerbots init, still short of the first bot-login batch
where it segfaulted last time.

**Watcher launched** (background, bounded ~200s). It will wake me the moment the
boot resolves into one of:
- **process dies** → crashed again (guard didn't cover it → we pivot to
  option 3);
- **reaches "World Initialized" and survives the bot-login window** → boot
  complete;
- **timeout** → still grinding, I'll re-check.

No separate timer needed — the harness re-invokes me automatically when the
watcher exits. I'll examine the boot logs then (including whether any B027
skip-lines fired, which is the diagnostic payload) and report back.

The server booted cleanly and is **stable** — reached `ready...`, process
alive, world ticks running, and critically: **zero segfaults this run** (grep
for segfault/terminate/assert came back empty). Errors.log holds only the usual
benign data warnings. The crash is fixed.

And the guard didn't just passively avoid the crash — it **actively caught the
fault and told us exactly what it is.**

## The diagnostic payoff

Across **185 bot logins**, the guard fired **2,292 times**, on exactly three
strategies:

| strategy | skips |
|----------|------:|
| `chat`    | 1336 |
| `racials` |  480 |
| `potions` |  480 |

Every other strategy (`default`, `cast time`, `duel`, `boost`, `aoe`, …)
passed with a valid facade. So this is **not** a rare race — it's **systemic
and specific**: those three strategies *consistently* arrive at `Engine::Init`
carrying a facade that belongs to a different or already-freed bot AI.

## What this means

- **Stability: solved.** The segfault is gone; the server runs. Option 2 did its
  job.
- **But B027 is currently a safety net catching a real, ongoing bug** — not
  the root-cause cure. Because it skips those strategies, the affected bots boot
  **alive but behaviorally degraded**: no racial abilities, no combat potion
  use, no chat behaviors. Stability-safe (nothing depends on them; `default` is
  never skipped), but not free.
- The "shared strategy context" idea I floated earlier is **not** the mechanism
  — `StrategyContext` is registered non-shared. So *why* these three specific
  strategies always carry a stale facade is a genuine lifetime bug still to be
  pinned — but it's now sharply scoped to three named creators instead of an
  opaque crash.

One health note: there was a single **150-second world-tick stall** at startup
(`Update time diff: 150377ms, 0 players online`) — the bot-login burst plus
2,292 `LOG_ERROR` writes. One-time and non-fatal, but if B027 stays long-term,
that per-skip logging will spam continuously as bots cycle.

## Where I'd go next (your call — I haven't touched anything further)

1. **Pin the real lifetime bug** now that it's localized to
   `chat`/`potions`/`racials`: trace how those three creators end up with a
   foreign facade (why them and not `default`). That's the fix that makes bots
   whole again *and* retires the skips — and it's effectively the deeper end
   of option 3.
2. **Use the server as-is** if degraded bot behavior is acceptable for now —
   it's stable and playable.
3. **Quiet the guard** (downgrade to `LOG_DEBUG` or rate-limit) once you've seen
   enough, so it stops flooding the log every bot cycle.

I'd also like to update issue 308's *current behavior* to record this verified
result (crash fixed; guard fires pervasively on three strategies) — but per
your "don't do anything unless I tell you to," I'll hold until you say go. Want
me to start on #1?

The trap is set. While it boots, here's where the investigation stands:

## Status of the hunt

**Eliminated by direct reading** (every link of the serving chain, on pristine
source, plus all patches that touch these files):
- Creator functions — all three are plain `new XStrategy(botAI)`, stateless,
  single registration each
- Constructor chains — `Strategy(botAI) : PlayerbotAIAware(botAI)`, forwarded
  correctly through `PassThroughStrategy`; exactly one facade member in the
  hierarchy
- Per-bot context — freshly `new`'d in the AI constructor for every class (I
  read the whole switch; no shared fallback)
- Config-driven strategies — `RandomBotCombatStrategies = ""` (empty, and the
  trio isn't named anywhere in the active conf)
- Our patches — B019/B021 are inert warning fixes; B026/B027 were already
  audited composed

That's a genuine paradox: statically, the strategy handed to `Engine::Init`
**must** carry the engine's own facade — yet exactly
`chat`/`potions`/`racials` arrive foreign, for every bot, starting *inside bot
#1's constructor*.

**So the answer is dynamic**, and the instrumented boot now running will catch
it red-handed with two tripwires:
- every **birth** of a `RacialsStrategy` (who constructed it, with which facade,
  full caller chain)
- every **guard hit** (which object, its facade vs the engine's, and whether the
  per-bot cache already contained it)

The one datum I most want: whether a `RacialsStrategy` gets constructed **during
config load** — before any bot exists. If yes, the caller frames in that first
`[CTOR]` record point straight at the culprit that's somehow feeding shared
objects into per-bot engines.

I'll report the verdict as soon as the catchpoints fire.

Round 2 is booting (about 2½ minutes to ready, then the login burst trips the
wires). While it runs, the state of play:

## What round 1 proved

The stale-facade theory was wrong in an important way. The three strategies
aren't inheriting a *dead bot's* facade — they're being **born with garbage**:

| strategy | facade value at construction | what it actually is |
|----------|------------------------------|---------------------|
| racials  | `0x2073616820676e69` | ASCII `"ing has "` — a string fragment |
| chat     | `0x68` | ASCII `'h'` |
| potions  | `0x100000000` | two 32-bit ints (1, 0) |

That's not a lifetime bug — that's **memory corruption or an uninitialized
read**, dressed up to look like one. And the maddening part: these creations
happen through the *same* per-bot context, on the *same* call path, interleaved
with creations that receive the correct facade — the value is good, then
garbage, then good again within one constructor sequence. A fixed heap member
can't do that on its own.

## What round 2 will decide

Two rival explanations, and the instrumentation splits them cleanly:

1. **Heap stomp** — another thread transiently writes string data over the
   context's facade field. The hardware watchpoint fires on the illegal write
   and prints the *stomper's* backtrace and thread. Case closed.
2. **In-flight corruption** — the member is fine, but the argument gets
   clobbered between `GetStrategy` reading it and the creator using it
   (cross-thread stack interference — plausible fallout from upstream's
   2026-07-10 world-thread-processor refactor). Then no stomp fires, and the
   ctor record will show `GetStrategy this->botAI = good` while `botAI-arg =
   garbage` — proving the corruption happens mid-call.

Either way, the next notification should carry the culprit's name.

completed (exit code 0)*

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Assistant Response 9 (continued)

> Round 2 tripped — reading the verdict:

Round 3 is booting (~2½ min). Recap of the evidence chain while it runs:

## The narrowing

| Round | Question | Answer |
|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Are the strategies shared or stale? | Neither — **born with garbage facades** (ASCII fragments, tiny ints) |
| 2 | Is the context member stomped? | **No** — hardware watchpoint silent; member is perfect in `GetStrategy`'s own frame, same thread |
| 2 | Where does the value die? | **Inside the `std::function` invocation** — between `create()` and `StrategyContext::racials` receiving its argument |
| grep | Why these three names? | **Insertion stride** — registrations #1, #9, #17 in the creators map; every 8th entry, not a property of the strategies |

The garbage shapes (UTF-16 text remnants, `'o','k'` bytes, plain null) are what
an **unwritten argument register** picks up — the trampoline calls the right
function but never loads the argument. That's the signature of a corrupted or
mismatched `_M_invoker` slot in the stored function object.

Round 3 dumps every entry of the live creators map — target, manager, invoker
pointers with symbol names. If the bad entries carry a different invoker than
the good ones (or point into non-code memory), we'll have the exact 8 corrupted
bytes and, from their contents, a strong lead on who wrote them. Then the fix
conversation is short: either a real upstream bug we patch precisely, or — if
the pointers implicate build inconsistency — a clean rebuild test before
anything else.

Round 4 is booting. The state of the hunt, compressed:

## Where five rounds of evidence have led

**Exonerated, with machine-level proof:** every line of C++ in the serving chain
*and* every instruction of its compiled code — `GetStrategy` →
`GetContextObject` → `create` → `std::function` plumbing — all preserve
the facade argument perfectly. The shared creators map is healthy at the moment
of failure. No duplicates, no torn nodes, one clean trampoline.

**The reframe:** my earlier "born with garbage" readings came from
constructor-*entry* breakpoints — exactly where gdb can read unspilled
parameter slots and lie. Discard those, and the trustworthy facts (the compiled
B027 guard firing, the original segfault, heap-member reads) point to a **heap
stomp after construction**: strategies are built *correctly*, then something
overwrites their facade field with string data in the microseconds before
`Engine::Init` checks them.

**Why always `chat`/`potions`/`racials`:** bot login allocates the same objects,
same sizes, same order, every time — so the same *relative heap chunks*
neighbor the overrunning buffer on every bot. The victims aren't chosen by name;
they're chosen by *address arithmetic*. Deterministic corruption masquerading as
a logic bug. (It also means B026's duplicate-login story may have been this same
overflow wearing a different costume.)

**Round 4's trap** watches the freshly built victim's own field — armed the
instant the object exists, when the base constructor has already stored the good
pointer. First write after that *is* the culprit, full backtrace attached. One
bonus read at arm-time (`facade@birth`) confirms construction was clean.

If the trap lands, we'll have the offending function red-handed — then the fix
is a targeted B028 upstream-style patch (and an upstream report with a beautiful
evidence trail).

how about, since this isn't our bug but instead is upstream's, how about when we
initialize these bots we just supply the required datastructures, hard-coded
because they're the same every time?

Done — your approach is implemented, verified, and ready to build.

## What changed: B027 is now *guard-and-repair* instead of *guard-and-skip*

Your idea, refined by one fact: the correct facade can't be a literal hard-coded
constant because it differs per bot (each bot's own AI object) — but the
**repair rule** is constant and known at the repair site. The engine is only
ever built inside its owning bot AI's constructor, so `Engine::Init` always
knows the true facade. The revised guard:

- **null strategy** → skip with an error (unchanged, redundant with B026 by
  design)
- **facade mismatch** → one `LOG_WARN` naming the strategy, **write the
  correct facade over the garbage**, then initialize normally

So instead of every bot silently losing racials, combat potions, and chat
handling (~2,300 skips per boot), the poisoned strategies get healed at the door
and work as upstream intended.

**Why round 4 makes this provably safe:** the field is corrupt *at birth* and
the hardware watchpoint proved *nothing ever writes it afterward* — so a
repair at init can't be undone by a later stomp. And the objects are genuinely
the right classes built by their real constructors — only that one field is
wrong.

**Updated artifacts** (all verified: single anchor match, idempotent, exact
round-trip, composes with B026 in both orders):
- `patches/B027-…facade-guard.sh` — repair logic + a narrowly-scoped `SetAI`
  accessor (commented "do not use anywhere else")
- `docs/patches/playerbot-engine-init-facade-guard.md` — full diagnostic
  evidence + the exact code, ready to replay on any fork and to serve as the
  upstream bug report
- `issues/308…` — current/intended behavior rewritten to the repair design,
  with the fallback (pin upstream pre-2026-07-10) recorded

The diagnostic server is stopped and the port is free. Compile when ready:

```bash
./scripts/compile
```

**What to expect in the log:** `…repairing it with the engine facade (B027,
issue 308)` warnings — roughly a dozen per bot login — replacing the old
skip errors. Each one is a healed strategy. Success looks like: clean boot, no
segfault, and shamans actually War Stomping / bots drinking potions / responding
to chat. If the warning volume gets old once trust is established, say the word
and I'll downgrade it to debug level.

One loose end worth keeping in the back pocket: the *upstream* root cause is
still unpinned (we contained it, per your call). The patch doc's evidence trail
— corrupt at birth, stride-8 victims, watchpoint-clean afterward, rev
`52f58186a533` — is ready to file against mod-playerbots whenever you feel
like it.

we should pin wow-chat-2026 to this commit until further notice. Also, let's try
and see if the bug is fixed. the compilation is done and the first worldserver
start logs are in.

kinda looks like the repair is happening every time. Can you examine the exactly
point when the strategies are checked in our code to see if we need to make
repairs more? maybe it's missing there! where is it missing? anyway can you
check the whatchamacallit

All three asks are done. The summary:

## 1. The bug is fixed — verified by the numbers

139 logins → **exactly 417 repairs (139 × 3), zero skips, zero crashes**,
boot to `ready...` in 1m11s, server stable. And your "repair is happening every
time" observation is the system working as designed: upstream corrupts the three
strategies **at every bot's construction**, so every fresh login needs its own
three repairs. The proof the repair *sticks*: each strategy is repaired exactly
once and never again — the skip era logged ~12 lines per bot because every
`Init` re-pass re-hit the same broken objects; now later passes find them
healthy and stay silent. Relogging bots will each log three more — that's the
expected steady state until upstream fixes their constructor path.

## 2. The coverage audit — no missing repair sites

You asked where else the check might be missing. I traced every consumer of
strategies:

- **All live-bot fetches** (`PlayerbotAI::GetStrategy`, pull-strategy lookups,
  target-value lookups) pull from the **engine map** — and nothing enters the
  engine map without passing `Engine::Init`, our repair point.
- **Runtime additions** (chat commands, toggles, instance strategies) use
  `addStrategy` with `init = true` by default → immediate `Init` → repaired
  before first use.
- **The batched adds** (`addStrategiesNoInit`) are always followed by an
  explicit `Init()` in every factory path.
- The **only bypass** is the travel manager's config-time enumeration sweep —
  it touches dummy data before any real bot exists, never live bots.

So the single repair point covers the entire live surface. One net, fully
strung.

## 3. Pinned until further notice

One correction while doing it: `52f58186a533` is the **core** tree's revision;
the module's own HEAD is **`93aaea3d`** (both 2026-07-10). The pin freezes both,
using the pin machinery the scripts already had:

- `PROFILE_COMMIT` → core `52f58186a533` for beta/release/vanilla (they share
  one source tree, so they must pin together; alpha untouched)
- `PROFILE_MODULE_COMMITS` → `mod-playerbots = 93aaea3d` for the same three
  profiles
- Mirrored in **both** `scripts/install` and `scripts/update`, with comments
  recording the why, the sibling-pin relationship, and the un-pin condition
  (upstream fixes the corrupt-facade construction; repair warnings vanish on a
  test build)

From now on, `update` will check out these exact revisions instead of pulling
— the diagnosed-and-contained ground can't shift under you. Issue 308 and the
patch doc now carry the corrected revision attribution, the pin record, and the
verification numbers.

Loose ends, in order of value: issue 308 could be marked complete and committed
whenever you're satisfied with play-testing (bots should now visibly War Stomp,
drink combat potions, and answer chat commands — worth a quick in-game poke);
the upstream report against `93aaea3d` remains packaged in the patch doc for
whenever you feel like filing it; and if the repair warnings get chatty once
trust is earned, one word and I'll drop them to debug level.
